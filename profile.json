Astronomy\nExplore a procedurally generated solar system through the lens of a spyglass!\n\nThe mod is entirely client-side and designed for helping with world-building and immersion, it is encouraged you think of lore about all the constellations you draw and planets you name!\n\nPlanets and stars will be the same for all players on a particular world, and are generated randomly (and largely scientifically accurately) per world, and you can easily share constellations between players using a client-side command\n\n![Screenshot of some planets and constellations from atop a mountain](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EdBSdqge/images/3dc17c154655fdc2dc7fc3989a38e16e9052d269.png)\n\n## Dependencies:\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (or the Quilt equivalent, although i have not tested this mod with Quilt)\n\n# How to use\n\nTo interact with the cosmos there are three spyglass modes: vanilla, constellation (amethyst), and star (emerald), these are cycled with the pick block button (middle click) while zoomed in.\n\nConstellation mode allows you to draw constellations by holding the attack button (left click) and drawing between stars, as well as being able to select constellations\n\nStar mode allows you to select stars and planets, note that comets are referred to as *planets* when using commands\n\nOnce an object is selected you can name it with `/sga:name <name>`, or get useful information with `/sga:info`, you can also get the information of a specific object without selecting it by following the suggestions after typing `/sga:info <x>`\n\nIf you're playing on a multiplayer server, you can use `/sga:share` or `/sga:share <x>` to share the currently selected or specified object respectively, this gives you a code you can send in chat or /message to someone directly, which allows them to easily add a constellation or name of a planet or star on their side, provided they have the mod too, of course.\n\nAll the client-side commands can be seen by looking at the suggestions after typing `/sga:`, or by looking at the list on [the github readme](https://github.com/Nettakrim/Spyglass-Astronomy/blob/master/README.md)\n\n*Older versions of Spyglass Astronomy are incompatible with the mod [Spyglass Improvements](https://modrinth.com/mod/spyglass-improvements), however Spyglass Astronomy comes with its own scrollable spyglass zoom, and other mods, like [Zoomglass](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomglass), exist to allow for spyglass

shaderpacks.\n\nThis mod forces Flywheel's optimizations to be enabled.\n\nFor those using shaderpack and mods depend on Flywheel, this mod can significantly improve fps.\n\nIf you don't use shaderpack, this mod has no effect. Because Flywheel's optimizations are enabled by default.\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\n\n\nThe shaders that have been tested are:\n\n\n\nBSL\nComplementary\nComplementary Reimagined \nSEUS renewed\nSildurs Vibrant Shaders\nAstraLex\n\nNew supported shaderpacks after 0.2.0:\n\n\n\nKapa 5.1\nNostalgia\nRethinking Voxels\nSEUS PTGI HRR\n\n\n\nThere are some shaderpacks that are also supported, but not listed above, so you can test them by yourself.\n\n\n\nThis mod only supports some specific versions of Iris or Oculus !!!\n\n\n\nIris&OculusFlwCompat   Iris or Oculus\n\n0.2.2 ---- >= 1.6.13\n\n0.2.1 ---- >= 1.6.5\n\n0.2.0 ---- >= 1.6.2\n\n0.1.9 ---- >= 1.5 and <= 1.6.1\n\n0.1.7~0.1.8 ---- >= 1.4 and < 1.5\n\n0.1.6 below ---- <1.4\n\n\n\n## Principle\n\nFlywheel uses a method called GPU Instancing to render entities. It is very efficient when rendering a large number of repeating entities (e.g. gears in Create mod). But when you use iris and enable shaderpack, this optimization is disabled. Because flywheel needs to use its own shader to render these entities and flywheel's shader will no longer work when you enable shaderpack.\n\n\n\nThis mod will automatically merge flywheel's shader with the shader in shaderpack when shaderpack is enabled to be able to render entities using Instancing.\n\n\n\nWhen you have a large number of entities to render, there is a huge CPU bottleneck with the original rendering method. This means that the better your GPU is, the bigger the FPS improvement from Flywheel.\n\n\n\n## How to use it?\n\n\n\n1.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully

Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it.

Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-02-12T22:46:13.376542Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1925931,"followers":2076,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"WdbHS4uT","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.2+1.20 (Forge)","version_number":"3.2.2+1.20-forge","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Backport a very important Forge fix to 1.20.1 ([#143](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/143)) *Enjarai*\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-12T22:46:14.453888Z","downloads":8376,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"12335cc91e372b646e607daa24e1a4f5f524bef3","sha512":"c86b4f39e5388ab31f8e627b477cd59063b539101970acc6accfbbd1a7f81d45b2420f8b2df2c6c10fc3594a8915473bd0e0d5a0a979c90fad21e4d02444a5a6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/versions/WdbHS4uT/yet-another-config-lib-forge-3.2.2%2B1.20.jar","filename":"yet-another-config-lib-forge-3.2.2+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":984522,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nwpe87D0","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"yet-another-config-lib-forge-3.2.2+1.20.jar"},"mods\\oculus-mc1.20.1-1.6.15a.jar":{"sha512":"bf5d1dd0d113f497b97d49dc75ba83ecb91d436bfedb8f337cc6e69a78a05841ac3b31bef7c508cdf2d0e66f787c2e647e37ff99c7a491f786bf72d66028f6fe","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"GchcoXML","slug":"oculus","project_type":"mod","team":"zFcUWaYx","title":"Oculus","description":"Unofficial Fork of \"Iris\", made to work with FML","body":"Unofficial Fork of \"Iris\", made to work with FML\n\nFeatures\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Features</summary>\n\n- Performance.

Food and drinks are consumed faster.\n* Perception: Increases visibility in the dark and causes mobs to be seen through walls.\n* Veil: Decreases monster detection range and hides your name behind walls.\n\nChestplate Enchantments:\n* Amphibious: Increases underwater mining and movement speed. Decreases air consumption underwater and time spent on fire. Immediately extinguishes you and allows usage of Riptide for 5 seconds after leaving water.\n* Strafe: Double tapping Left Control (configurable) launches you in your movement direction.\n* Wardenspine: Harms attackers and greatly decreases damage taken from behind.\n\nLeggings Enchantments:\n* Dash: Pressing Left Shift (configurable) in the air launches you in your look direction.\n* Slide: Holding Left Control (configurable) while grounded causes you to slide constantly. Pressing Left Control (configurable) in the air causes you to slam towards the ground, knocking back mobs and negating fall damage.\n\nBoots Enchantments:\n* Buoy: Causes you to walk on fluids, descending via sneaking. Holding jump while submerged rapidly propels you upwards. Prevents floating. Grants a speed boost for 5 seconds after leaving water.\n* Bouncy: Negates fall damage. Launches you upwards upon landing while not sneaking. Sneaking while grounded will charge a super jump.\n* Gale: Allows you to jump more times in the air.\n\nSword Enchantments:\n* Berserk: Increases damage dealt proportional to missing health.\n* Frostbite: Freezes attacked mobs. When killed, turns them into ice statues that can be moved or shattered, launching ice shards that freeze other mobs.\n\nBow Enchantments:\n* Chaos: Gives normal arrows a random negative potion effect, or positive if sneaking.\n* Delay: Arrows will not launch immediately after shooting, building up damage over time. Can be launched prematurely by punching, and additionally redirected by sneaking.\n* Phasing: Causes arrows to have no gravity and phase through blocks, upon which they regain gravity.\n\nCrossbow Enchantments:\n* Brimstone: Fires a piercing laser that ignores armor and increases damage with charge and distance. Costs health to fire.\n* Scatter: Allows Amethyst Shards to be loaded which explode into a burst of projectiles.\n* Torch: Allows rapid loading of Torches that ignite shot mobs. Torches that land on a block will be placed if fired while sneaking. The Crossbow can only load Torches.\n\nTrident Enchantments:\n* Leech: Regenerates health when dealing damage. Thrown Tridents will temporarily stick to mobs and deal damage.\n* Warp: Teleports you to the location of the Trident if it didn't hit a mob.\n\nPickaxe Enchantments:\n* Extracting: Extracts materials from connected ores, leaving the stone behind. Disabled while sneaking.\n* Molten: Smelts mined blocks. Disabled while sneaking.\n\nAxe Enchantments:\n* Beheading: Slain mobs and players have a chance to drop their head.\n* Lumberjack: Connected logs will also be destroyed. Disabled while sneaking.\n\nShovel Enchantments:\n* Bury: Using on a mob will bury it if the ground below is soft enough.\n* Scooping: Deals extra damage and increases mob loot drops.\n\nFishing Rod Enchantments:\n* Disarm: Steals or disables a latched entity's held item.\n* Grapple: Allows the Fishing Bobber to latch onto blocks. Launches you towards that block upon release. Reels in entities with more strength.\n```\n\nOf the core changes, this mod will:\n* Overhaul the Enchanting Table with a new UI that removes the RNG involved in enchanting; you may simply choose the enchantments you wish to have.\n* Force items to only allow one enchantment.\n* Remove leveling from enchantments, meaning that the max level for all enchantments will be 1. Enchantments that are brought down to this level will act as their original max level counterpart, an example being Riptide I will function the same as Riptide III. Enchantments on gear made from materials easier to obtain will be weaker.\n* Remove durability from most aspects of the game. There is an item tag to allow certain items to keep durability.\n* Remove most vanilla enchantments from the game. Enchancement tries to make choosing your enchantments more fun and engaging by replacing many of the boring stat change enchantments with enchantments that grant the player unique abilities.\n\nEnchancement also adds some quality of life changes:\n* Add Coyote Bite, which allows attacking an entity for 3 ticks after it leaves your crosshair.\n* Adds descriptions to the tooltip of enchanted items and colors enchantment names green.\n* Fishing Bobbers are accurately thrown instead of having a weird offset.\n* Infinity is allowed on Crossbows.\n* All Tridents have Loyalty built in as a native effect.\n* Channeling works during any weather, not just when thundering. Channeling also creates lightning that does not create fire or destroy items, and ignites entities for 3 seconds on melee attack.\n* Crossbows can pull projectiles from your inventory instead of just from your off-hand.\n* Drowned will use the data of their held Trident when throwing it.\n* Enchanted chestplates will increase your air mobility.\n* Bows are drawn faster and don't decrease your movement speed as much.\n* Fire Aspect is usable as Flint and Steel if you are sneaking, and ignites for less time.\n* Enchanted Books are free to merge with items in an Anvil.\n* Luck of the Sea acts as if the item also has Lure.\n* Ender Pearls no longer deal damage upon landing.\n* Projectiles ignore invulnerability frames (with damage falloff) and negate velocity.\n* Mobs can spawn with any random enchantment.\n* Iron armor has been made stronger and Golden armor has been made slightly weaker.\n* Tridents will automatically return to you if thrown in the void.\n* Golden Apples can only be eaten while hungry.\n* Makes a select few potions a bit weaker to account for the removal of some enchantments.\n* Weapon enchantments such as Fire Aspect or Frostbite will not function unless the player's attack cooldown is >= 70%.\n\n**Q: Can I disable any of these changes?**\n\nA: Everything in the mod is configurable down to disabling the entire mod if there are features that you wish to disable. All of the config options are self explanatory except for enchantmentLimit (0 means no limit, greater than 0 means items cannot have more than that number of enchantments) and unbreakingChangesFlag (0 means all items are unbreakable, greater than 0 means items with x level of Unbreaking are unbreakable, and less than 0 means disabled). Items in the `enchancement:retains_durability` tag will ignore these changes and act as normal.\n\n**Q: Why did you remove most of the vanilla enchantments?**\n\nA: I do not like how much of the vanilla enchanting meta relies exclusively on Protection, Sharpness, Power, and other such stat increasing enchantments. I also dislike Fortune because it incentivizes not mining ores until you have Fortune, which I find incredibly dumb.\n\n**Q: I want to keep every enchantment anyway. How do I do this?**\n\nA: In the configuration file, remove all entries from disallowedEnchantments. Keep in mind that while this shouldn't cause any bugs, any balance concerns created by doing this will not be addressed as it is outside of the scope of the mod's vision.","published":"2023-02-26T23:26:11.805730Z","updated":"2024-02-09T22:27:25.087267Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":38243,"followers":269,"categories":["magic"],"additional_categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","utility"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["J3VF5aKI","VBmLq71s","1jQBg2iC","XgxAbBT8","MHt8fUEA","BNyQlGJb","3V7rAdGr","7tpmc9Ec","ntFxiV8A","9Gs1wjY8","6GV3zBoH","PsBjrP6q","6ldvVCsq","r50YuIjO","R9FVJyM8","Zjd3QA2q","NL3vY26b","4ST9jBlc","rXKUEgw3","oKSMJh5v","zcSRfFiA","p6EDNsCr","hEqeyQxM","PAsOuxQg","IHZV3v8B","kCJ2DnM6","ZMU3BiTX","OC5PAcny"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6hN1V6wJ/9028ca8e8fa38cbc043305481119d12ef4b743b0.png"},"version":{"id":"Zjd3QA2q","project_id":"6hN1V6wJ","author_id":"VylMiU5U","featured":false,"name":"Enchancement 1.20-8","version_number":"1.20-8","changelog":"-fix https://github.com/MoriyaShiine/enchancement/issues/135\n\n-fix https://github.com/MoriyaShiine/enchancement/issues/138\n\n-fix curse of vanishing not being included in the disallowed list by default\n\n-mobs can now spawn with random enchantments\n\n-buff bouncy\n\n-fishing bobbers now have accurate aim\n\n-drowned now use data from their held trident when throwing it","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-23T02:47:26.984991Z","downloads":2164,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"94808310324e7a072f2c9a3ee51111d3a81e948e","sha512":"9280f4909a5a671326aaf7878ec0e290082eb2e3bce1cde81a70a02a47584dd2477c4db7dcb17f474b884bb3b29157610e0ad33208f139362877c3da312b8819"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6hN1V6wJ/versions/Zjd3QA2q/enchancement-1.20-8.jar","filename":"enchancement-1.20-8.jar","primary":true,"size":1121088,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"2RKFTmiB","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"K01OU20C","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"codAaoxh","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EZhgRQ9J","user":{"id":"Ef5Yk50C","username":"Up","name":"Upcraft","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10714589?v=4","bio":"🌐 upcraft.dev","created":"2020-11-26T23:31:37.288243Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"EZhgRQ9J","user":{"id":"wbAGDjBN","username":"RAT","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25477005?v=4","bio":"Engineering student, Minecraft modder and texture artist.","created":"2021-01-29T17:34:13.590001Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"EZhgRQ9J","user":{"id":"jYrrCGqK","username":"cybercat5555","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17956808?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-07T17:38:49.822848Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"EZhgRQ9J","user":{"id":"VylMiU5U","username":"MoriyaShiine","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/45156123?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-13T17:29:40.235897Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enchancement-1.20-8.jar"},"mods\\youwereslain-1.0.0-1.20.x.jar":{"sha512":"c5c314ff7feab104b938916708b9d912ba6e1a94c749414629bb286ffae8ce6db6a9e2d1552ae6003a6826e2883d9848b042d1519e7fdb868ceeca91259f06f6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"SfSneJdD","slug":"you-were-slain","project_type":"mod","team":"kan5HgHq","title":"You Were Slain","description":"Customize the death screen unlike ever before!","body":"# You Were Slain\n\n### Customize the death screen unlike ever before!\n\nYou Were Slain allows you to edit multiple elements of the death screen.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

Quality Sounds gives each block its own unique, high-quality audio profile for placing, breaking, stepping, and hitting. Every sound matches the block's physical characteristics, adding realism and immersion to your block interactions. \n<br><br>\nEach wood type and leaf block gets custom sounds that fit its real life counterpart's density, texture, and flexibility.

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nSleep Tight is a very comprehensive rebalance and **overhaul of the Minecraft sleeping system.**\n\nThe mod's main goals are:\n\n- Slow down early game progression, making it so sleeping off the night isn't always a no-brainer\n- Rewards player for prioritizing their \"home bed\" instead of placing random beds down every night\n- Offers late game options to sleep immediately without setting your spawn point (and without associated penalties)\n- Expand the sleep system by allowing players to rest during the day\n- Adds some drawbacks and dangers to sleep such as nightmares, sleep encounters and bedbugs\n\nOverall sleeping should feel more rewarding and balanced while still being fun and engaging at the same time with its new encounters mechanics. The mod late game should feel like vanilla but with added benefits\n\n> The mod is highly configurable. Just want the hammocks with no sleeping changes? You can do just that!\n<hr>\n\n### 🛏 Night Bags 🛏\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/dee42b5dd4643454e75db0a987a810bb31330bed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"197\">\n\n- A late game item crafted with echo shards and phantom membrane\n- Serves as a temporary bed that does not set your spawn point\n- When used will immediately place the player in sleep mode on the spot\n- Upon waking up they will go back in your inventory. Perfect for camping!\n- Does not prevent Phantom spawn nor provide any benefit\n\n<hr>\n\n### 💤Hammocks💤\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/ce174aba2c57bc4ef7edb6632d848d1510f542c9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"178\">\n\n- Allow players to rest during the day\n- When laying on one you can swing back and forth by pressing \"a\" or \"d\" movement keys\n- Come in all different colors\n- Can be attached to either 2 fences with 2 blocks in between or in a 3 block space against 2 blocks\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🪳Bedbugs🪳\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/7406d71aaed17430f670c918555400a55bfbc804.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"263\" height=\"184\">\n\n- A disruptive mob that has a rare chance to spawn right after you sleep in a bed on high difficulties\n- Normally they ignore the player and sprint toward any bed close by\n- Once they reach a bed they will burrow in it making it unusable/\"infested\"\n- To solve this you'll have to use a potion of harming on the bed itself\n- Can pass through doors\n- Can also rarely spawn in the wild and will attack players when no beds are in sight\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🏠Home Bed🏠\n\n- Sleeping at least 8 times in the same bed will mark it as your \"home bed\"\n- Once a bed gets marked you'll receive a new effect, Invigorated, upon waking up\n- Invigorating increases xp drop from ores and mobs for a long period of time making it a valuable reward for committing to the same bed\n- Be sure not to break or let your bed be infested as doing so will reset its home bed status\n- Sleeping even more nights on the same bed will increase the Home Bed level even further up to a max of 100\n- Home bed status can be viewed in a newly added icon in the sleep screen\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🌒Nightmares🌒\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/e0ec71bed38bc049d458bf7249f26d4fb49f3e84.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"231\">\n\n- You can now lay on a bed or hammock without sleeping. This allows you to move your camera and access your inventory like normal\n- Successuflly sleeping will now have a cooldown. By default this will be 5m but some events, such as sleep encounters or nightmares will inflict much harsher penalties\n- You can view your current cooldown in a newly added status bar right below your crossair when aiming or resting on a bed\n- While sleeping you will see the current time on the left corner of your screen\n- Beds will no longer violently explode when in the nether. They will instead only make a tiny blast. You can also disable the explosion entirely allowing you to sleep there\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🧟Sleep Encounters🧟\n\n- Formerly known as \"bad dreams\" this is an old mechanic that was removed in previous versions of mc\n- When sleeping next to a dark spot you'll have a chance to get woken up by a mob that could have naturally spawned there\n- No longer are you safe to sleep in a dark cave!\n\n<hr>\n\n### 😪Sleep Benefits & Requirements😪\n\nThe mod offers many ways to customize your sleeping experience. Here are all the options that it offers with their default behavior\n\n- Sleeping requires full hunger (default off)\n- Sleeping requires an xp toll (default 0)\n- Sleeping will grant a status effect (Invigorating only for home beds as explained above)\n- Heal when woken up (default on)\n- Clear all effects when woken up (default on)\n- Consumes hunger when woken up (default on)\n\nAll these can be turned on or off individually for each bed type (bed, hammocks and sleeping bags)\n\nThe rest of the mod is equally configurable so be sure to check the configs for a more in depth explanation\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>\n\n## 💜Mod Integration💜\n</center>\n\nWhen Heartstones mod is installed sleeping next to a Heartstone owner will grant both of you a regeneration effect\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓Q&A❓\n</center>\n\nQ: This mod seems tedious. I just want hammocks and my op beds back\n> A: Just turn off all the difficulty features in the configs. The mod is entirely customizable\n\nQ: How do i get rid of bed bugs?\n> A: You'll have to account for that, hunting for them when you wake up if you hear one. Smart house construction can also help\n\nQ: I dont like X feature, how do i change it?\n> A: Everything is extremely customizable in the mods configs. Infact mod also contains some optional features off by default\n\nQ: Does this work for multiplayer?\n> A: Yes! Some features like nightmares will account for all the players nightmare change and a \"nightmare night\" will be rolled accordingly. Only the player that actually got a nightmare will be set on cooldown\n\nQ: Why does this mod nerf bed in early game?\n> A: Because being able to skip the only part of a day where mobs spawn above ground without consequences in a game built around surviving mobs seems pretty op to me.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":586823,"followers":755,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"4FXHDE9F","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.53 (Forge 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

Ores such as Uranium and Guanostone Redstone Ore can be processed properly. Amber can be crushed to guarantee a Curiosity.\n\n### Cutting (Sawing)\nPewen and Thornwood logs can be sawed. Get more Dino Nuggets from dinosaur chops. Tough Hides and Notor Gizmos can also be sawed.\n\n### Deploying\nMagnetic Lights and Holocoders can be made using deployers. Electron tubes can be made from those extremely electron-tube looking things called Notor Gizmos. Also adds a way to make Precision Mechanisms more easily. \n\n### Spout Filling\nAcid can now be poured into various items. \n\n### Mixing\nMix Ambersol from Blaze Powder, Amber and Glow Berries. Scarlet and Azure Neodymium can be exchanged for one another. Mix Acid by combining Water and Sulfur Dust. Get more Ping-Pong Sponges if you already have one.\n\n### Crafting Table\nCraft the Enigmatic Engine and Geothermal Vents.

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering\neffects, and is currently not supported by Embeddium directly. Lazurite is based upon the reference implementation Indigo,\nwhich is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.20.1/fabric-renderer-indigo).\n(licensed Apache 2.0)\n\nLazurite is **not supported by Indium**. Please, **do not** report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker\nor in their Discord. Use Lazurite's issue tracker for reporting bugs.\n\nThe [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) and [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) are required to run Lazurite.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Which mods require Lazurite?\n\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Lazurite when used with Embeddium. These include: Campanion, Bits and\nChisels, LambdaBetterGrass, Continuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an\nimplementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n### Does Lazurite affect performance?\n\nLazurite's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves\nimpact performance. Lazurite will not provide a performance benefit over using only Embeddium.\n\n## Credits\n- comp500 and contributors for creating Indium, making FRAPI support on Sodium possible\n- embeddedt for their Forge port of Sodium\n\n## License\nLazurite follows the license of upstream Indium, which is the [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/comp500/Indium/blob/1.20.x/main/LICENSE) license.","published":"2023-10-28T10:37:58.835010Z","updated":"2024-02-11T13:46:14.338317Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":23488,"followers":63,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["optimization"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["ErDMMxQv","ybcLjzgh","LZ2ZcLrG","7XSkM0oe"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TkC4Gtkt/babe95629ae9703732f323d44fb4efc05324e7e3.png"},"version":{"id":"7XSkM0oe","project_id":"TkC4Gtkt","author_id":"5qUpS9rY","featured":false,"name":"Lazurite 1.0.3 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Embeddium 0.3.1","version_number":"1.0.3+mc1.20.1","changelog":"- Update Embeddium to 0.3.1 (Su5eD)\n- Coerce entity render layers into block layers (Su5eD)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/Su5eD/Lazurite/commits/1.0.3+mc1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-11T13:46:14.808411Z","downloads":5174,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3c9e8654a398c4dabf6c99cd0669d4659057d2f8","sha512":"04946f73cd7fa1cc40782364e1e71dffbc93bd55119b2472a1f26165686bb622afca786faa6ede8858f873bd9c60d4781738ee07ce4b3df84daecf71e135d416"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TkC4Gtkt/versions/7XSkM0oe/lazurite-1.0.3%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"lazurite-1.0.3+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":128960,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"ZDL24WiX","project_id":"sk9rgfiA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Orvt0mRa","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Aqlf1Shp","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"YU5tYqjH","user":{"id":"5qUpS9rY","username":"Su5eD","name":"Su5eD","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51261569?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-02-19T12:55:46.760294Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lazurite-1.0.3+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\PacketFixer-forge-1.20.1-1.2.8.jar":{"sha512":"3b8a4f8165a1bffb9d61a257b04fca084e75e3a30210befdfa9284ab63d37419d8424adc9576e64603802bf2a10559f492767fad875c24cf8eeaf6fca36dcaf2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"c7m1mi73","slug":"packet-fixer","project_type":"mod","team":"3h9GHUuw","title":"Packet Fixer","description":"A simple mod to solve various problems with packets.","body":"# Packet Fixer\n#### Visit my discord server: [Link](https://discord.com/invite/vWBP4P4Yd8)\n\n## Description\nThis mod fixes various package erros.

\n\nAlex’s Caves is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that adds 5 new cave biomes to the Overworld. Unlike most normal biomes, these cave biomes are exceedingly rare - yet they all contain a variety of unique blocks, items, mobs and mechanics that makes them considerable subterranean destinations. These five biomes are the Magnetic Caves, the Primordial Caves, the Toxic Caves, the Abyssal Chasm and the Forlorn Hollows. \n\n \n\nTo find any of these cave biomes, you’ll need to discover an Underground Cabin anywhere in the overworld. From there, you will find loot barrels with cave tablets and a Cave Compendium - a guide book for Alex’s Caves that should provide you with all the knowledge needed to find and explore any biome added by the mod. For more information on getting started, see the ‘[Getting Started](https://alexscaves.wiki.gg/wiki/Guides/Getting_Started)’ section on the mod’s wiki.\n\n \n\nAlex’s Caves is a very large mod with a great deal of effort put into the look and feel of each new biome. Each biome added may have its own ambient particles, fog, brightness, light color and more. Because of this, it is recommended to experience this mod without shaders, since many shaders can alter or worsen the unique appearance of several of the biomes. The mod also has built-in compatibility with Just Enough Items and Alex’s Mobs.\n\n \n\nAny additional questions can be answered on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/alexsmods), and bugs can be reported on [Github](https://github.com/AlexModGuy/AlexsCaves).\n\n \n\n### Credits:\n\n#### Creators:\n- Alexthe668: programmer and co-creator\n- Noonyeyz: artist and co-creator\n\n#### Sound Team:\n- PrismaticPinky: sound design\n- LudoCrypt: musician\n- Gatetoh: musician and sound design\n- Arby698: sound design\n- RenRen: musician\n- _Ninni: sound design\n\n#### Documentation Team:\n - HolidayRaptor: documentation\n- PlummetStudios: documentation\n","published":"2023-11-04T17:47:20.616416Z","updated":"2024-03-06T17:29:17.761970Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":88877,"followers":377,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["equipment","food","game-mechanics","magic","technology","transportation"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["VOMqwoQ3","JnyjMWKA","zUdjxO9k","gCvzvSsJ","e7H7vKvS","SLvvjh2O","RplA7oyA","3yOJpMFg","pdifL7d0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U6GY0xp0/4165eef78a7efa0f5acda964dd094c08ee0e5680.png"},"version":{"id":"pdifL7d0","project_id":"U6GY0xp0","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Alex's Caves 1.1.4","version_number":"1.1.4","changelog":"-Slightly increased volcano generation distance\n\n-Added tag to exclude entities from being spawned from amber monoliths\n\n-Fixed magnetron only being made out of stone\n\n-Fixed gammaroaches being hostile to cows\n\n-Fixed giant bat holograms\n\n-Fixed missing luxtructosaurus sound console spam\n\n-Fixed endermen spawning in abyssal chasms\n\n-Fixed atlatitan making too many stomping noises at once\n\n-Fixed vallumraptors eating their own eggs\n\n-Fixed deep ones spinning whilst trading\n\n-Fixed abyssal altar not having a take item animation\n\n-Fixed primal magma not being avoided by mobs\n\n-Fixed grottoceratops forgetting its target occasionally\n\n-Fixed cooked tripodfish being eaten very fast\n\n-Fixed crash with notors scanning cobblemon entities\n\n-Fixed sated blade enchantment not increasing saturation level\n\n-Fixed hullbreakers getting crowded out of spawnpools by other mods\n\n-Updated toka pona translations\n\n-Updated chinese translations","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-06T17:29:21.111667Z","downloads":5325,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a84b72fed62fde027a06cc086531b923726729ea14e1f04c9fa20898b5667d332eb1fa24d93e346a0990b4cfdad78ead6e7e265ba61a96dae5dcae7ea9f415d4","sha1":"3899837681e024ab4d520301346980fe51eceffa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U6GY0xp0/versions/pdifL7d0/alexscaves-1.1.4.jar","filename":"alexscaves-1.1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":61508689,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"jJfV67b1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ri6vA5Gk","user":{"id":"KJbDpjKi","username":"Noonyeyz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42457241?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-05-06T12:46:00.258719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"ri6vA5Gk","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"alexscaves-1.1.4.jar"},"mods\\Copperative 1.20.1--1.1.0.jar":{"sha512":"0978b85462fcd285ba59fc5997b4d33859a56d30132d4ce1d4e5ffbfcf533afda6d73f10086261bcdaac6525a2269d8464c8c726a416a74f808404d4ce9319b3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"f9rb8trZ","slug":"copperative","project_type":"mod","team":"jlv5DjCP","title":"Copperative","description":"Rightfully uniting copper and redstone components as one and expanding on copper as a whole.","body":"![Title Copperative](https://i.imgur.com/uFJyQQc.png)\n![the lil seperation line](https://i.imgur.com/ySyLyUr.png)\n[![akliz ad](https://i.imgur.com/aD9X866.png)](https://www.akliz.net/galena)\n![the lil seperation line](https://i.imgur.com/ySyLyUr.png)\n\n![visual image](https://imgur.com/EtPIXDF.png)\n## 📖 About:\n\nCopperative is a Minecraft mod that enhances the use of copper. Unlike other copper mods, we have added exciting new features to copper that complement its existing properties and give it a unique role. One significant change we made is replacing stone with copper for all redstone components. This opens up exciting possibilities for future additions, like the Toggler and the Headlight. Additionally, we have introduced many new building blocks that work well with copper and made building with copper easier by adding features like patina scraping and wax indication.\n\n![the lil seperation line](https://i.imgur.com/ySyLyUr.png)\n## 📺 Showcase:\n\n \n\n \n### [⚙️General Changes⚙️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWsqtIdCmpg&t)\nThis video introduces the addition of Copper Nuggets and the ability to get Patina from scraping copper blocks.\n\n### [🏮🕹️ Redstone Components 🕹️🏮](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F2mOxHxAhE)\nThis video showcases this mod's changes to redstone components, mainly how it changes that those components that are made of cobblestone in vanilla minecraft get now made with copper. These can also by oxidized, not naturally, but only by manually right clicking them with patina. With this you can more easily distinguish each line of redstone and cause less chaos while doing redstone contraptions. \n\n### [🏛️🧱 Building Blocks 🧱🏛️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB20k-q2Y0U)\nThis video showcases this mods additions to building blocks.\n\n### [♨️ Compatibility ♨️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY2wKHylSk)\nThis video showcases compatibility with other mods\n\n### [🐝Wax Indication🍯](https://youtu.be/asX2nCUF1Os)\nIn this video, we showcase how you can see the particles around blocks that are waxed when you hold up a honeycomb.\n\n### [🪨Prismarine Crafting🪨](https://youtu.be/JCvca3Xc1jk)\nIn this video, we showcase how in Copperative you can craft Prismarine Shards and Prismarine Crystals out of Patina and some other items.\n\n### [📟💎 Toggler 💎📟](https://youtu.be/uwduY6QP4e4)\nCopperative's new exclusive redstone component!

Not only have we expanded the amount of mobs in vanilla Minecraft that can be tamed, but we have also fixed several problems with these mobs, added new items and blocks to improve the tamed mob experience, and have introduced a new Pet Enchanting system. Asides from the new command system, most of these changes should be reflected in both mobs from vanilla and new tamed mobs introduced in other mods, like [Alex's Mobs](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-mobs).\n\n\nWith Domestication Innovation installed, no more will your pets have to sit out battles, exploration and more at home. Now they can join the fun without worry of permanently loosing them, or them being completely outclassed by other mobs and mods.\n\nFeature Breakdown:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Wander, Stay, Follow</summary>\n\nWolves, Cats, Parrots, Axolotls, Rabbits, and Foxes now have 3 possible states when tamed: Wander, Stay and Follow. These can be cycled through by right clicking on the mob. Now its finally possible to have your cats and dogs wander around your house instead of being frozen in place or randomly teleport to you. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Swing Through Pets</summary>\n\nUnless sneaking, the swing of your sword, fist, or any attack will pass right through any tamed pets of yours. They will hit any possible mob behind the pet as well. This means you are free to get in the battle with your pets without fear of hurting them! This change applies to arrows and other projectiles as well. If you do want to hurt the tamed mob, you can hold sneak during the attack. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n \n<details>\n<summary>Sweeping Edge Changes</summary>\n\nSweeping edge can now no longer hurt any tamed pets of yours.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Axolotls</summary>\n\nGone are the days of weirdly holding a tropical fish bucket if you want to use an Axolotl as a companion: These amphibians are now fully tameable! Simply feed a wild axolotl a few tropical fish to tame them. They can be made to sit, wander and follow like all the other tameable mobs. Note that axolotls are by default very slow on land, dry out and have low health - you have been warned. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n <details>\n<summary>Tameable Foxes</summary>\n\nTrustable mobs have always been somewhat scuffed in implementation. Thankfully, we've made it so that tamed foxes are actually tamed - and can be made to sit, wander and follow like the other pets. To get a tame fox, you need to breed two wild foxes with sweet berries and wait for it to grow up. Note that no matter how tame foxes are, they'll still want to kill any chickens and (untamed) rabbits they can see. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Rabbits</summary>\n\nWhen they were initially added to the game, rabbits were fully tameable just like cats and wolves. However, this was eventually removed. We've undone this change and made them like the other tamable mobs above. To tame a rabbit, feed it several Hay Bales. Rabbits only have 3 health by default and usually (see: Sinister Carrot) cannot attack. However, to make them useful we have reintroduced another removed feature: rabbits scare off ravagers. Both them being tameable and the scaring of ravagers are configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Frogs</summary>\n\nLots of people have frogs as pets in the real world... right? Now you can tame them in Minecraft with a few spider eyes. Frogs can be made to stay, follow or wander like the other pets, and will come to their owner's defense. They may have low attack and health, but they sure make up for it in cuteness.\n\n</details>\n\n \n<details>\n<summary>Pet Beds</summary>\n\nPet Beds are new craftable blocks that are made like so:\n\n![Pet Bed Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/KPuMzoc.png)\n\nNote that they come in all 16 colors.\n\nBy moving one of your tamed mobs onto a pet bed, you enable it to respawn there the next morning if it somehow dies. The visual indication for this is if you see a bunch of ZZZ particles appear above your pet's head: this means it has set its respawn point. To remove the respawn point, simply break the bed block.\n\nMobs can only respawn at dawn, so if your pet dies some other time you will have to wait until then to see it again. Pet enchants are preserved with respawning, but more on that later.\nThe respawning of mobs in beds is configurable.\n\n\n</details>\n \n<details>\n<summary>Wayward Lantern</summary>\n\nThe Wayward Lantern is a decorative block that can be crafted from iron ingots and a lantern. If you are ever so far away from your pets in 'follow' mode that they are unloaded from the world, they will eventually find their way back to the closest Wayward Lantern to you. This makes it perfectly fine to die far from home and not loose both your pets and your loot.\n![Wayward Lantern Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/DxNMqzo.png)\n![Wayward Lantern](https://i.imgur.com/vyGTkiF.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Feather on a Stick</summary>\n\nFeather on a Stick is a new simple tool crafted like so:\n![Feather on a Stick Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/P3LFZcE.png)\n\nWhen used, this will send out a feather on a string in front of you. The closest pet of yours will then try to move onto the feather to play with it. This tool is useful for getting your mob out of places it shouldn't be, like if it's stuck in a doorway or on top of a chest. It's also useful for moving a pet onto its bed so you can set its respawn point.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Rotten Apple & Sinister Carrot</summary>\n\nRotten Apples have a chance to form if an apple item despawns on the ground (configurable). These green, wormy apples can be fed to a horse in order to turn it into a zombie horse. Note that you'll want to make sure the horse is tamed and saddled prior to this action. This zombification process will also preserve the speed and other aspects of the horse. Zombie horses cannot wear armor.\n\nSinister Carrots are rarely found as loot in Woodland Mansions (configurable). They can be fed to a zombie horse in order to turn it into a skeleton horse. They can also be fed to a tamed rabbit to transform it into a Killer Rabbit, which can attack and is much stronger than a normal rabbit.\n\n</details>\n \n<details>\n<summary>Animal Tamer Villager</summary>\n\nAnimal Tamers can be found in villages in their own unique houses (spawn rate configurable) or can be created with a unemployed villager using a pet bed as a workstation. They trade a variety of items related to animals from both vanilla minecraft and this mod, including unique pet enchants(charisma). Their houses also contain some untamed mobs and sometimes fish tanks.\n\nThe Animal Tamer villager can be disabled via the config.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Deed of Ownership</summary>\n\nThe Deed of Ownership is an item that can be purchased from the Animal Tamer villager. By right clicking on a tamed pet that you are the owner of, you bind it to the deed. If you give the deed to any other player, and they use it on the bounded animal, then the ownership of the pet will pass onto them, making it effectively as if they were the ones who tamed the animal.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Command Drum</summary>\n\nThe Command Drum block has been added to automate commanding groups of mobs via redstone. Craft it like so:\n\n![Drum Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/yiCKvad.png)\n\nWhen interacted with, the drum will beat and change command modes, whilst ordering all tamed mobs of the user to follow, stay or wander depending on the beat. If given a redstone signal, it will command the mobs of the player that originally placed the block. The block also makes a funny sound if you jump on it.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Collar Tags</summary>\n\nCollar Tags are the conduit for pet enchantments. They can be crafted like so:\n![Collar Tag Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/xf0lLlf.png)\n\nLike a nametag, these collar tags can be renamed in an anvil and used on a mob to rename it (unlike a nametag, this is only for animals that are your pets). However, their real use is that they can be enchanted (configurable).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Enchanting Your Pets</summary>\n\nPets can be enchanted by applying enchants to a collar tag in either an anvil or an enchanting table.\n\n![Enchanting a collar tag](https://i.imgur.com/gytL7ov.gif)\n\n\nThese collars can then be placed on a tamed pet of yours by interacting with it. To get the enchanted collar back, you can simply swap it with any other collar, including an unenchanted one. You can view a pet's enchants by sneaking and looking at them.\n\n![Enchanted Wolf](https://i.imgur.com/eA9swxP.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>All Pet Enchantments</summary>\n\n35 Pet Enchantments are added, including 4 curses and 5 loot/trade exclusive enchantments. These are:\n\n- Health Boost I-III : Pet gains 10 additional maximum health per level.\n- Fireproof : Pet cannot be damaged by fire or lava.\n- Immunity Frame I-III : Pet gains immunity frames (1 second for each level) after attacked, donated by an energy barrier overlay. While active, pet will not be damaged further during this time.\n- Deflecting : Pet is protected by a ghostly shield which deflects any projectile attacks.\n- Poison Resistance : Pet cannot be inflicted with poison effect.\n- Chain Lightning I-II : When attacking, Pet shoots lightning that arcs from the target to nearby mobs. Perfect for dealing with swarms of mobs like zombies. Level determines amount of mobs the lightning arcs between.\n- Speedster I-III : Increases pets movement speed.\n- Frost Fang : Inflicts attack targets with frozen effect (ie. powdered snow effect) that slows them and damages them over time\n- Magnetic : Pet is aided by a ghostly magnet which pulls attack targets closer to it.\n- Linked Inventory : Pet can pick up items and teleport them to its owners inventory.\n- Total Recall : When below 2 health, pet enters a recall orb and is protected from any further damage until released by its owner.\n- Health Siphon : Transfers any incoming damage from the pet to its owner, if nearby.\n- Bubbling I-II : Pet attacks trap target inside a giant bubble which floats upwards and pops, sending the target plummeting to the ground. Level determines duration of the bubble. Only found as loot in Buried Treasure.\n- Herding I-II : Pet can be followed by untamed animals. Level determines maximum amount of followers.\n- Amphibious : Pet cannot dry out (if aquatic like axolotls) or drown (if a land animal) in water or on land. Improves movement underwater and allows land animals to properly swim instead of splashing at the top of the water.\n- Vampire's Familiar I-II : Pet regains a portion of health for each successful attack. Level I is 50% of the attack, level II is 100%. Only found as loot in Woodland Mansions.\n- Void Cloud : If pet falls off a cliff or into the void, a cloud will be summoned to lift it back up and towards its owner, if nearby. Only found as loot in End Cities.\n- Charisma I-III : Lowers trade prices if near owner. Level determines how great of a deal is given. Only given as a trade by villagers.\n- Shadow Hands I-IV : Pet gains dark magical abilities in the form of shadow hands that emerge from the creature. These hands deal melee damage at a decent range. Level determines count and speed of hands when attacking.\n- Disc Jockey : Pet is followed by a magical jukebox that can play any record on loop.\n- Defusal I-III : Pet will nullify any nearby explosion, such as from creepers or TNT. Level determines range of effect.\n- Warping Bite : Pet will teleport target away from itself when attacking.\n- Ore Scenting I-III : Pet will occasionally sniff out local ores and highlight them to nearby players. Level determines frequency, range and amount of ores highlighted. Only found as loot in Abandoned Mineshafts.\n- Gluttonous : This pet can eat any food if low on health to heal, ignoring dietary restrictions and negative effects of the food.\n- Psychic Wall I-III : This pet can summon a psychic wall of energy between its owner and any close monsters during combat. This wall will stop any unfriendly entity from walking through it. Level determines size of wall, length and frequency of the effect.\n- Intimidation I-II : This pet can occasionally scare all nearby monsters away from it. Level determines frequency and range.\n- Tethered Teleport : This pet will automatically teleport with you whenever you do when following. That includes through portals, via commands, ender pearls and more.\n- Muffled : This pet will not emit sound or vibrations. Only found as loot in Ancient Cities.\n- Blazing Protection I-III : This pet is surrounded by multiple (2 per level) blaze bars, which absorb incoming damage and ignite attackers. Only found as loot in Nether Fortresses.\n- Healing Aura I-II : When this pet or its allies are injured, it will create a circle of regeneration around itself, healing nearby mobs.\n- Rejuvenation : This pet can absorb experience orbs when injured to convert to health points.\n- Curse of Afterlife : If pet is slain, a hostile, zombifed version of it appears, with all the enchants and abilities of its past life.\n- Curse of Infamy : Pet attracts attention from nearby monsters, which will begin targeting it.\n- Curse of Blight : Random flowers, crops, grass blocks, etc. will wither and die occasionally when this pet is near.\n- Curse of Immaturity : Pet appears as a baby animal version of itself, and deals less damage when attacking.\n\n\nMost of these enchants are not compatible with each other and have varying levels of occurrence. See the chart below:\n![enchantment chart](https://i.imgur.com/6sXKEjV.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>A Word on Mod Compatibility</summary>\n\nThe Wander, Stay and Follow command system is implemented for vanilla mobs only. It is up to other mods to develop a similar system for their mobs.\n\nHowever, all other features of the mod like the pet beds and enchants should work with any tameable mob in other mods.\nEnchants from this mod are compatible with Enchantment Descriptions.\nMobs from Alex's Mobs should spawn by default inside some of the Animal Tamer's cages in villages.\nIf you are a mod dev and want to make sure Domestication Innovation works out of the box for your mod, remember to make sure your tameable mob's class extends TameableAnimal.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Possible Future Additions/Roadmap</summary>\n\n\n- Pet Shops in villages and Animal Tamer villager\n- Improved Parrot AI\n- Additional Items for small animals like cages and perches\n- More enchantments\n- Improved mod compatibility\n\n</details>\n\n[Join our discussion on discord!](https://discord.gg/alexsmods)\n[Report bugs of this mod on

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3. Do not include the options.txt and servers.dat from the root directory in your modpack\n4. Fresh installations (meaning no existing options.txt) will now start out with your default options\n\n**If you are using FoamFix Anarchy Version**, disable `B:initOptions` in the FoamFix config or else Default Options will not work. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/blay09/DefaultOptions/issues/25) for more info.","published":"2022-06-14T21:15:45.532802Z","updated":"2023-12-28T18:16:18.338623Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":171531,"followers":51,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["J2H2vpLI","YN36x9Jb","nw9yrzag","jJxa5Gmc","HSWQDe7S","LlFwkgUx","9tmOVtry","Pb0E8WZN","Et9oI0rT","QSc3hlWR","aiy49T0Q","o32sAXGh","NdWk53Qq","h2fGLwAL","gUEpxWEe","iuGiPVsP","QIKpMBgZ","CKNINccT","n1N8gK1t","srYLHGmM","wRqU3JuA","64N7yejA","7P1WUDrG","ayHJIZRi","w9xvfauD","HYa1CJIc","E01imSXQ","NqeV4Paq","dKbEPttX","1ND1cFJv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WEg59z5b/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"CKNINccT","project_id":"WEg59z5b","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"18.0.1+forge-1.20","version_number":"18.0.1+forge-1.20","changelog":"- Fixed modded keybinds resetting on every launch on Forge","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-10T20:42:17.439457Z","downloads":48017,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"73af2309627a68a7bff3e53e02ea22fb5c4651e5","sha512":"41ab37f580a1cbcb063958b7ec6034c9bea729aecb5452e5982a21d068617a818e78d31f03e76fc4e06dbf73f066f576d9dd6566f70d4912f29b595ba5c54079"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WEg59z5b/versions/CKNINccT/defaultoptions-forge-1.20-18.0.1.jar","filename":"defaultoptions-forge-1.20-18.0.1.jar","primary":true,"size":87942,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"NRF4uKO7","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EhVsb590","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"defaultoptions-forge-1.20-18.0.1.jar"},"mods\\panorama_screens-1.0+forge+mc1.20.jar":{"sha512":"ea42da5958248dc2e84302de9145a01500052c41fe1642f80fae1a9b47e93f442dc484ddb952052067a83c8199030aa8bc484cc8b36ecf2f6e5ff45cdf76d27e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4k0QM1rC","slug":"panorama-screens","project_type":"mod","team":"Us9fMwaF","title":"Panorama Screens","description":"Enhance Minecraft menus by adding the rotating panorama background to most screens!","body":"<p><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4k0QM1rC/images/d6c93e4a7b4a108333644963c35fac0d080ea474.gif\" alt=\"Panorama Screens Banner\" width=\"1200\" height=\"563\" /></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Forge\" href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\"><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/652/189/forge-banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title=\"Fabric\" href=\"https://fabricmc.net/\"><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/652/190/fabric-banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/652/191/versions-banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"30\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Panorama Screens is a mod that enhances Minecraft screens by adding the title screen rotating panorama background.

Supported versions in **bold** (but I'll try to support the other versions too within reason).\n\n- Place items down by pressing `P`\\* while looking at a block. Rotate all with `Sneak + P`.\n- Rotate item with `Sneak + Use`. (Requires two empty hands.)\n\n\\* Note (for 1.16.4+): The `P` key used by Plonk conflicts with the Social Interactions Screen key so you'll have to change one or the other!\n\nYou are free to use this mod in any modpack (no need to ask!).\n\n## Description\n\n- Place up to 4 stacks of items on the side of any block using the Place Item key (defaults to `P`). (Max size of each stack is configurable and supports StackUp!)\n\n- Items can be individually rotated to 16 different directions (Sneak + Right Click using empty hand).\n\n- The whole tile of items can be rotated as a whole to 4 different directions (Sneak + Place Item key using empty hand).\n\n- Items can be extracted by automation but not inserted.\n\n- Can not be washed away by fluids anymore. ~~Placed items can be washed away by liquids.~~\n\n- Can be waterlogged (as of MC1.16.3+).\n\n- Config at `config/plonk.cfg` (before mc 1.13) or `<save folder>/serverconfig/plonk-server.toml` (after mc 1.13)\n\nThe look of the placed items and the mechanics are currently subject to change.\n\n## Known Bugs\n\n- Third person camera collides with block (1.7.10 and 1.12.2 only). Not sure how to tell minecraft to let the third person ray trace pass through (1.13+ has RayTraceContext.Visual)\n\n- Translucent items (e.g. Stained Glass) cause other translucent things behind them not to render properly.

Not only can you create custom records with full customization with the new **Etching Table**, Etched also provides new ways to play all discs. The new **Album Jukebox** lets you store up to 9 records which will play in order and on repeat unless powered by redstone, which then it'll pause and reset to the first disc. The **Jukebox Minecart** lets you play music on the rails with the ability to insert records into it with hoppers or, if the song is ended, restart the song with an activator rail!\n\n### 📦 Features:\n\n- The new bard profession for villagers with various musical trades.\n- New ways to play music such as the Jukebox Minecart,  Album Jukebox, or Radio! Play songs on the go, live from a radio station, or multiple songs in order on repeat, just like an album.\n- Insert records into jukeboxes with hoppers! A parity feature from Bedrock.\n- Create your own custom records with the Etching Table!

Once you've got the necessary components, you can select the pattern of the label under the component slots to make your disc look pretty and the URL to your song goes in the bar above! Etched currently supports URLs that lead to an **MP3 File**, **WAV File**, **OGG File**, **SoundCloud Song** (GO+ songs are not supported, regardless of subscription status), **Bandcamp** Song, or a **Minecraft Sound Event**.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.moonflower.gg/curse/content/etched/disc_smelt.png\" width=\"192\" height=\"136\">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cdn.moonflower.gg/curse/content/etched/disc_trade.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"134\">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cdn.moonflower.gg/curse/content/etched/etching_table.png\" width=\"260\" height=\"136\">\n  \n#### How do I obtain a Blank Music Disc?\nThese wouldn't be records without some sort of challenge.

This irritates the cells in human eyes through a short series of acidic chemical reactions, producing an iconic reaction.\n\nThis mod adds the ability to cut onions into slices (rings) to achieve a similar effect! The varying impacts of chopping onions are detailed further in the config.\n\n### Advancements\n- **Cry Me a River:** Make a Ghast shed a tear by cutting onions nearby.\n- **Ninjas Cutting Onions Again...:** While invisible, bring at least ten creatures to tears by cutting onions.\n\n## Config\n\nYou can alter the following:\n- Does cutting onions have any impact at all? (default: **true**)\n  - (Note: setting this to false basically turns this into a mod that just adds two or three foods.)\n- Does peeling Big Onion blocks from [Overweight Farming](https://modrinth.com/mod/overweight-farming) with an axe have the same effect as cutting onions? (default: **true**)\n- Block radius within which blocks/entities are affected\n  - Default: **2**. Must be an integer. Capped at 16 to prevent extreme performance impacts.\n- Does cutting onions cause damage to entities at all? (default: **true**)\n- Chance of making ghasts shed a tear. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.5**)\n- Chance of converting obsidian into crying obsidian. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.25**)\n- Chance of growing nearby weeping vines. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.75**)\n\n### Tags\nThis mod adds two primary tags:\n- `onion_onion:unaffected_by_onions`: an entity type tag populated with mobs that do not react to onions being cut in their vicinity. Includes skeletons, bosses, and a couple other creatures by default.\n- `onion_onion:onion_proof_helmets`: entities wearing items from this tag on their head do not take onion-related damage. Includes items that cover the eyes, such as the diving helmets from [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create).\n\n- There's also a minor item tag for `motley_mushrooms` to include mushroom items that belong in the motley grill recipe. By default it includes compat with [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery).\n---\n\n**Requires [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) and [Blueprint](https://modrinth.com/mod/blueprint).**\n\nNote: this mod is *not* affiliated with vectorwing.

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

experience.\n\nThe improvements lie between a 20-30% speedup when generating new chunks in vanilla Minecraft (benchmarked on 1.20.1 Fabric).\n\nNoisium changes some world generation functions that other mods don't touch, to fill in the gaps left by other performance optimisation\nmods.\nMost notably, `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise` is optimised to speed up blockstate placement when generating new chunks. There are also 3\nother smaller optimisations, that increase biome population speed, chunk unlocking speed, and the speed of sampling blockstates for\ngeneration.  \nIn `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise`, setting the blockstate via abstractions/built-in functions is bypassed. Instead, the blocks are set\ndirectly in the palette storage, thus bypassing a lot of calculations and things Minecraft does that are normally useful when blocks are\nset, but when generating the world only slow it down, this is a cycle optimisation.\n\nNoisium has full 1:1 parity with vanilla worldgen (worldgen without Noisium).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\nNone.\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\nNoisium should be compatible with most, if not all, of the popular optimisation mods currently on Modrinth/CurseForge for\nMinecraft `1.20.x`, since Noisium aims to fill in the gaps in performance optimisation left by other mods.\nThis includes (but is not limited to) C2ME, Lithium, Nvidium, and Sodium.\n\n- Distant Horizons: Noisium speeds up LOD world generation threads, since LOD generation depends on Minecraft's world generation speed.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nNo known incompatibilities at this time.\n\n## Download\n\n[![GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/github_vector.svg)](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium)\n[![Modrinth](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)\n[![CurseForge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noisium)\n\n![Fabric](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/fabric_vector.svg)\n![Quilt](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/quilt_vector.svg)\n![Forge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/forge_vector.svg)\n![NeoForge](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/24de632923c03864d65568a2cb5ce1e2cee0a304/docs/assets/badges/compact/supported/neoforge_vector.svg)\n\nSee the version info in the filename for the supported Minecraft versions.  \nMade for the Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge modloaders.

height=\"59\" /><br />\nThe ultimate upgrade to Minecraft's desert temples! YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any resource packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal resource packs).

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious. What can I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Try <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Tweaks</span></a>, a mod by <a

The ringling will eat bouncers dropped from nuts or fed by hand from the player. When ringlings are fed bouncers, they become full and will begin digging through the indigo eylium below them, they will occasionally dig up ancient roots and rarely a rooting blade. Ancient roots can be eaten to submerge yourself one block into the ground, it can also be brewed into a rooting potion, which causes this effect for a longer duration. The Rooting Blade will apply that effect on hit for about 3 seconds.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YtHVhRs.png\" width=\"1128\" height=\"555\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">&nbsp;The Enderneath</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The enderneath is an upside down ancient overgrowth, hidden below the end islands and lightly based around radioactivity. Lots of irradium ore generates within the biome and new threats called \"stalkers\" lurk here. Stalkers are very tough mobs, some of the toughest in the game as a matter of fact! They'll try to knock you off the platforms in the enderneath giving you an effect called \"burdened\" in the process, which will greatly increase your falling speed. Furthermore, killing a stalker will cause it to drop stalker its meat and ocassionally its teeth. Stalker meat is a very good food source since the stalker is a challenge to slay, and the stalker teeth can be crafted together with bismuth ingots to make a serrated hook, which has extra range and will bring mobs to your position when attacked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>glow gourds, azure berries, and cerulean stalk are also found only within this biome. Glow gourds grow down from cerulean vines, and overtime they'll sprout open with fronds off the sides, which allows them to be harvested slices that cause radiation when eaten. Azure berries grow off of lichen-like vines. These berries are very useful as they provide levitation to any player that eats them, letting you save yourself from a fall or escape from the enderneath. Lastly, cerulean stalk can be found here, which is an opposite of bamboo that grows downwards and can be turned into a light blue wood-set.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6VBFhrg.png\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Ooze Seeps</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The ooze seeps is a biome based around ooze and bubbles, with mobs and blocks to fit that theme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ooze can be found here, which is a new liquid found exclusively in the end. Ooze has many properties such as :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items, projectiles, boats sliding across the ooze surface.</li>\n<li>Most entities will stay completely still and not sink or float while in the liquid.</li>\n<li>You cannot drown in the liquid.</li>\n<li>Going in the liquid applies a new effect called \"enderstride\" which teleports the player to where they are looking randomly.</li>\n<li>Ooze can speed up the growth of some nearby crops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Big gas vents that produce giant bubbles are littered around the biome. They also have different effects depending on what liquid or gas is placed a block below the lowest part.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eleviblooms, a new crop, grows here. Eleviblooms will grow in multiple stages only on chorloam, and when harvested multiple elevibloom berries will begin floating into the air, eventually falling down. Eleviblooms can be eaten to encompass the player in a giant bubble, which can be popped by attacking it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gloops are a new creature which is also found here. Gloops will occasionally harvest grown eleviblooms and then eat the floating berries. If they eat enough of the floating berries they will eventually begin dripping jelly, which at this point allows you to right click them with a bottle and harvest the jelly. Bubble jelly can be eaten for a new effect, \"bubbling\", which will encompass any hit targets in a giant bubble. Furthermore, bubble jelly can he made into a bubble jelly block, which rapidly increases the velocity of whatever entity walks in it to that of the blocks direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fumesplats also call the ooze seeps home. Fumesplats will occasionally fill up with ooze over time, and then splat the ooze all over its enemies, including the gloop, it's natural enemy. The splat causes a new effect called \"suffocation\". Suffocation will slowly drain the oxygen of any mob who has it, almost like air-drowning. If fumesplats are killed, they can drop a suffocation gland which can be brewed into a suffocation potion.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FGJWq6E.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1126\" height=\"569\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Gaseous Gardens</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The gaseous gardens is an upper end biome which is based around the noble gases.

client-side mod that adds RPG-like titles when entering biomes or dimensions.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely customizable - change text size, color, location, duration, &amp; more</li>\n<li><b>Includes

href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-02-20T23:18:05.163730Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":302923,"followers":576,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"oUSK4sOQ","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Forge)","version_number":"1.20-Forge-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added support for the following mods: Mine Cells, Eden Ring, Deeper Darker, Aether, The True Backrooms, VoidZ, Atlantis.  \n- Added partial Chinese and Japanese translations.  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T20:30:04.061112Z","downloads":10042,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"64a435eaa6e08fff5af2c720c3b6a40fe292f2f7","sha512":"7cafbfc39305f3e384468db674e350118950201ba4d22b66ed95516a335aaad04765ae1e693b223c6c5beba404fc7411e9f78b4f962d7d9e51407b55233375a4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/versions/oUSK4sOQ/TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar","filename":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":228191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Forge-4.0.2.jar"},"mods\\rebindnarrator-forge-1.20.x-1.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"d1f120a8d3c2a09c335351b6bc62153b0c59c4f2be1f454432f60c10186edce97073a6df1aa7fe464a6a6ce324c5718a9f4a4704a3a3a1e5ddc6f4367c58b58a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"elMC8kn3","slug":"rebindnarrator","project_type":"mod","team":"6XINHREM","title":"RebindNarrator","description":"Rebind that pesky narrator keybind!","body":"This mod unlocks the ability to change the keybind to enable the narrator.

The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:54:53.998919Z","updated":"2024-01-08T01:33:06.845232Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":146299,"followers":129,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["e9Hq3hbv","3yzqBh3Y","qmq8DyRI","YXklcDpN","CSAWSThG","FpT1xZyZ","iGVkOHlW","gCz8FYyg","FzbfQajL","HkfL3iGO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/72c932a650b6ca3830a1dd82ee86eb7f05f589ef.png"},"version":{"id":"HkfL3iGO","project_id":"z53V2L4P","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Smooth Boot (Reloaded) 0.0.4 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.0.4","changelog":"This update uses a specific amount of main worker threads you can change it in the config, while the old updates uses the number of the available threads, resulting in worse performance.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T01:33:07.890390Z","downloads":22827,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3fd79132dba444bd109b5de4ad75dee06a48e130","sha512":"1cf706491339f3efae0d48d0dd596f27a74fcfa8e94008d7ef55e18be8c6f3c437bb74020e48910e1cc724ad35894bffce94788fe8f765c37048d4cc532ba261"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/versions/HkfL3iGO/smoothboot%28reloaded%29-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar","filename":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":41044,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nBB8t1rq","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar"},"mods\\extrasounds-1.2c-1.20.1-forge.jar":{"sha512":"93beed13049dabdd3abaa0e0480f2cec54e20bbc4e0d08722939c82a3c125c2944e52495ce5952b8177a04aea704bd5544f1e2e917143d894fbd2d4cd61552c9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jv7tzVE4","slug":"extrasoundsforge","project_type":"mod","team":"jiIWRmBu","title":"ExtraSounds Forge","description":"UI sounds & more.","body":"# Extra Sounds Forge\n\nAdds more sounds to Minecraft, like sounds when you scroll the hotbar, the creative inventory, pick up or place items in inventories, and more!\n\n## Features\n* Hotbar scroll sounds\n* Inventory click sounds (based on clicked item)\n* Drop sound (based on amount of items dropped)\n* Creative inventory scroll sound (based on scroll speed)\n* Chat message sound\n* Chat @mention sound\n* Every sound is configurable!\n\n## [Demonstration video](https://youtu.be/PG3VZ_DmbRk)\n\n### Porting From:[Extra Sounds](https://modrinth.com/mod/extrasounds)","published":"2023-12-03T09:59:06.990826Z","updated":"2024-02-22T16:12:36.854197Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":10996,"followers":28,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["1sIaM83Q","53P7bV0V","3M6udakl","hzh6SCu2","lQiAmsR7","7ogYhggw","iIbpGweH","Y8LGdaPs","cMwPKG7q","eZCiE2rt","xzDkInoJ","16ZaXM2V","E7ui4mmH","QEn28hem","rNFA0643","SaUCQMBY","V6ZUi4qN","4lGFmeqh","VDgFY02l","Hh8kvpns"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jv7tzVE4/aac60640bfd4a44890f075aea150fac41e698da4.webp"},"version":{"id":"Hh8kvpns","project_id":"jv7tzVE4","author_id":"REhLdPc0","featured":false,"name":"ExtraSounds Forge 1.2c","version_number":"1.2c","changelog":"* fix: Config cannot be generated correctly in 1.18.2\n* fix: Compatibility Issue -

Mobs","description":"85+ New mobs with stylistic quality above the default game.","body":"![Alex's Mobs](https://i.imgur.com/Se0dRBJ.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is a Forge mod that adds 89 new mobs to Minecraft. All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n##\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n<br>\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n##\n\n### Placeholders\n<br>\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n##\n\n### Config\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n\n```toml\n# Lets you enable /

with your food in main hand and it would do the trick but be aware that it may produces some noise, so do it in secret\n\nTest your food on your pets to stay safe! or maybe test it on your friends :)\n\nadvanced tooltips were slightly changed to hide nbt count in food items, this way you really cant know which item was changed! \n\nlingering potion would affect the entire stack instead of just

compatibilities have been moved into an addon mod: [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/media/demo.gif)\n\nEnables moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.\n\nAlso hides the darkened background tint in inventories that don't pause the game.\n\nBoth features can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.\n\nThis mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.<br>\nI take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on Forge/Fabric/Quilt.<br>\nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) on Fabric.<br>\nRequires [Quilted Fabric API / Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) on Quilt.<br>\nFor Fabric, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to be able to open the config screen.<br>\nFor Forge, I also recommend [Game Menu Mod Option](https://modrinth.com/mod/gamemenumodoption) so you can change settings in-game.\n\n## Config (In-game)\n\n#### General:\n- Enable Mod: Enable the entire mod\n- Debug Display: Enables a debug overlay that can help debug compatibility problems.\n\n#### UI Movement:\n- Move In Inventories: Enable movement in inventories<br>\n  There is a keybind you can set to toggle this setting (unbound by default)\n- Allow Jumping: Allow jumping in inventories\n- Sneak Mode: How to handle sneaking in inventories:\n  - Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens Background: How to handle screens that pause the game:\n  - Show = Always show background\n  - ShowSP = Show background in singleplayer, otherwise allow hide\n  - AllowHide = Allow background to be hidden\n\nThe Movement and Background pages also have expandable categories containing toggles for individual inventory types.<br>\nThe base mod only has a category for vanilla inventories. For more mod compatibilities, see [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\nAny screens not handled by installed mod compatibilities are added to the \"Unrecognized UI Types\" section, grouped by modid.\n\n## Usage\n\nFeel free to use in packs if you wish.\n\nThe only official downloads are from the InvMove GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>\nBe careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>\n(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)\n\nThe mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/blob/master/COPYING)","published":"2022-02-20T20:50:17.872579Z","updated":"2024-01-13T05:51:54.299414Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":529226,"followers":885,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g6dHjPlj","Nw08AijY","zSjRFisS","KlCCrdyH","z1wUcYrz","Rowb4urF","FxtmKzFE","nyLttvyA","2PM0Ne3I","mXm80CHn","nc2YXBFR","ZUUyXFpC","KZODMPL5","YglVnx4G","AvfVeby1","aarEmm3o","VgnPhVTW","Clo0PUhb","FlJXgCDA","ODrlrF3Z","whx4cyXm","DjMssqvc","FJ91FXja","O575lNuT","dGo1L388","2tK5XdF0","um5St4s3","u2qv60JQ","sVkuPH9Y","qTu058ya","gn5FSncy","sWRkeaiE","LG7n0kA8","RKDVymOM","UTuW1mu8","RsLNtqpA","H2moqgPv","kzI0tILB","2sYsuomN","1uJ8OF0p","Q59zS7Fb","NudOSeIR","L9gZxJNb","VE4bOg3y","WzbaGwer","pfLgaUxC","hrMnbArx","920571eR","h6ELnOF4","JxGn75dh","vk2Y8XQV","WIXovitR","AE0sDDm3","W5h8ZaUy","kqq0UN1u","6CNOChud","1BZ0wHLG","LGhnGid6","VSooa0oK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/7c10ef4460c5b2998dac53a494ec9051851f0e76.png"},"version":{"id":"6CNOChud","project_id":"REfW2AEX","author_id":"U9xrZlQH","featured":false,"name":"v0.8.4 (1.20.0/1)","version_number":"1.20-0.8.4-forge","changelog":"(note: marked as alpha because I did not have time to test every version/loader)\n<br>- Update for 1.20\n<br>- Workaround for issues with certain freecam mods ([gh-19](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/issues/19))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-18T23:58:21.898641Z","downloads":48105,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5a68c14eca94747c78b4492c781612d17b450c05","sha512":"f7d7a683c2e4899d013c207c1f11bee7f1f3354e47345972d9e3f60dcab411255755720520496c72ef79469ed2e07cf61a2890f686b70e055119fd4b119608e7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/versions/6CNOChud/InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","filename":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":125604,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"JoLgnJ0G","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"1rXrl5vy","user":{"id":"U9xrZlQH","username":"PieKing1215","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13819558?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-05-27T06:09:15.544829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar"},"mods\\TradingPost-v8.0.2-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"c401f6bdd7aaef623bbc5c55fbd1d33184a427ad7f89bc7713050cb7adb61346badea266009b8f9ecf3624ea3e537a4b23d7f360ecf369e9d208b2df8902777c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8pcjMDgj","slug":"trading-post","project_type":"mod","team":"K2fL2IkP","title":"Trading Post","description":"Rule the village!

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

few things:\n- Increases the maximum amount of chat messages from 100 to 16,384\n- Adds a timestamp in front of all messages, formatted as `[HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND]` in pink text, with a tooltip that renders a complete date\n- Keeps chat history and previously sent messages across ALL worlds and servers\n- Allows logging chat messages for restoring them later in future Minecraft sessions\n- Lets you modify vanilla player names to anything you want (ex. without the triangle brackets!)\n- Minimizes spam with a counter that shows how many duplicate messages have been sent in a row\n- Shifts the chat hud up by 10 pixels, so it doesn't overlap with the armor bar\n- Provides a menu to copy specific data (and the text of course!) from chat messages\n- Lets you search through all received messages with a search bar\n- All of this is configurable, with much more to offer!\n\nThis mod also provides features from a multitude of other mods, including:\n- [More Chat

lookout for new versions, issues, and future features!\n\n## FAQ\n\n- What Minecraft version can I use this with?\n  - The *latest Fabric* versions of Minecraft, plus 1.18.x. *Quilt* appears to work, but I don't provide official support for it.\n- Will you make it for (older Minecraft version)? \n  - Not likely. The oldest version I'll be making is 1.18.x. Any older version would only be supported if it is generally recognized as a modding-LTS version and if it is commonly requested, because backporting is boring and makes me want to die.\n- Will you make this for Forge? \n  - Probably at some point after all the major changes I want to implement are finished. But right now, I doubt it. Fabric's API is simple, and I am too lazy to learn Forge's until then.\n- I found a bug/issue, what do I do?\n  - First, make sure you have the latest version of the mod for your Minecraft version. If it still persists, you can click on the Issues tab on this page, and nobody has opened one about your issue then create one! Note that a lack of provided information will increase time needed to fix.\n- It says I need to install Fabric, but I already have it installed?\n  - [Install the Fabric API.](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n- Do servers need this mod? \n  - It is client side, so no.\n- I can't access the config menu in-game!\n  - <u>For 1.19.2+:</u> After ensuring YACL and Mod Menu are installed, if you still cannot access the config, check for an error message and [open an\n    issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/issues/new/choose). If there isn't an error message, [open an issue anyway](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/issues/new/choose) and follow the instructions in the issue template.\n  - <u>For 1.18.x:</u> You need the LATEST versions of both [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/versions?l=fabric&c=release) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions?l=fabric&c=release) to access it in game.\n  - <u>For all versions:</u> You can always edit the config at `(directory)/config/chatpatches.json`.\n- My config is broken/not working!\n  - When you load one of the more recent mod versions, it makes a creates a new file with your old settings and resets the main file. You can access this\n    copy at `(directory)/config/chatpatches_old.json`. By then opening both the new and old configs at the same time, you can copy and paste over the values.\n    Make sure the settings have correct inputs (ex. `time` should be `true`/`false` not `123` or `\"true\"`). If you still are having problems, open a new issue on GitHub.\n\n## Localization and Translation\n\nIf you would like to help translate Chat Patches into other languages, you can:\n- [Create a pull request](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/compare) that adds, corrects, or updates a language file *(preferred)*\n- [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/issues/new) with the language file attached\n- DM me on Discord (@obro1961)\n\nOnce you contribute, [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/3MqBvNEyMz) so you can receive your Contributor and Translator roles!  \n\n\n\n### [Find out more information on the GitHub page!](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches#readme)\n### Any suggestions and/or issues are much more likely to be addressed if they are made on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/issues).\n\n[![Get 15% off your first month with code OBRO15!](https://i.imgur.com/9mjs77B.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=234)","published":"2022-07-26T17:13:15.684750Z","updated":"2024-01-21T05:25:21.479620Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":168829,"followers":383,"categories":["decoration","social","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["TBBMUG9r","pG5NPlnE","mzcT7MTa","243ESwKL","9AXNr0QH","7FXb20M1","O565vXpo","MrJhmT55","1xacIWvm","l88z20nu","umIMH7nh","YsDqsLoB","ccnqllV5","ftpbGARS","qLYGesDs","Hxb0TdO6","N2JveFUL","AMqWHq6z","mkSBPVio","3nBkrqCu","qC5vnv9F","JMrqdKRS","CNkfvfgA","IU2NpQdC","p9vyGSUA","3v7NKbwy","PXjUBLOF","q2ipKuqv","b3ZL3st2","mjlFxkfG","lyjYrZZr","yAnJTT2l","MTvcOi4I","AKNqioZO","Xuy9EuwZ","Qo2u33Ns","C3BmhD5L","SuJk5vFM","rIcsIYC8","lXK3AMbd","7uhNBAzE","3Y4dmZD1","AWV0aVEo","TC2Pejkl","LPwnOOhD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MOqt4Z5n/56c954dea290ef4dd1b0d6ea92a811acac62ca85.png"},"version":{"id":"C3BmhD5L","project_id":"MOqt4Z5n","author_id":"H7iOJdg4","featured":false,"name":"201.5.5","version_number":"201.5.5","changelog":"## Chat Patches `201.5.5` for Minecraft 1.20, 1.20.1 on Fabric, Quilt\n- YACL images now load without crashing the game!

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nJust Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED) is a JEI plugin that provides useful information regarding status effects.\n\nThe mod adds a new Effects recipe category accessed either by clicking any of the newly added status effect icons on the JEI item screen or by clicking an active effect from its box on the inventory screen.\n\nHere you'll be able to view information regarding such status effect such as items that can provide it or its description as well as which mod it's from or its effect color.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8qv5ZN.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UfGgoGG.png)\n\n<center>\n\n## 🧪 Customization 🧪\n</center>\n\nThe mod automatically adds all registered status effect to its page, however modded effects won't had a description.\n\nModders can easily add such descriptions to their effect by adding the string `\"effect.[mod_id].[effect_name].description\"` to their language file.\n\nSince the mod can only automatically detect food items as effect providing ones, mod developers can also easily add support to their custom effect or effect providing items by adding some recipes into their mod.\n\nTo do so one can simply use one of the two newly added recipes categories:\n- \"jeed:effect_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can provide an effect in the following format:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:effect_provider\",\n  \"effect\":{\n    \"id\": \"minecraft:haste\"\n  },\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:beacon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- \"jeed:potion_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can contain any registered potion like tipped arrows for example:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:potion_provider\",\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:splash_potion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:tipped_arrow\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you would like to help me provide build in description support for many modded effect be sure to contact me on my discord!\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-03-03T15:49:49.763780Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1938029,"followers":3149,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"NhH3bdcX","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"-

They appear most frequently in mountainous regions.\n\nHot air balloons can be ridden and flown. Players must use flint and steel and sand to ascend and descend respectively. The player can use shears to remove unwanted sandbags.\n\nAnother unique characteristic of these balloons is that the player cannot control the direction that they float in. Instead, players must use a Gust Gauge in order to monitor the wind direction. Wind blows in a different direction every day. It also blows in a different direction every 32 vertical blocks. This means you are able to change directions at different altitudes.\n\n### Requires GeckoLib\n\n</details>","published":"2023-09-20T02:15:17.919093Z","updated":"2023-10-16T21:13:38.182104Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":3978,"followers":59,"categories":["adventure","transportation"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["c8qRWgaI","5u0PrlLl","Dg8eYgqd","4SjLzXFR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AiTMEFuN/9484555a5cb0796e8ce93382f527f06fd6cb51ad.png"},"version":{"id":"Dg8eYgqd","project_id":"AiTMEFuN","author_id":"CfMhpqoJ","featured":false,"name":"Breezy 1.20.1-1.1.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.1.1","changelog":"- Fixed server startup crash","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-16T21:10:06.720900Z","downloads":3037,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"658fc7c2269ecd2a3a55608ea05e440113946d74","sha512":"7b548dc67d3cefacf8d0762e0c0068256803b7a2e45c3514d72d780792be63473dbcad9a0bf7b20a3903322db5ad1f49e1319c97552bacb48004e9ccb7b4059e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AiTMEFuN/versions/Dg8eYgqd/breezy-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar","filename":"breezy-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar","primary":true,"size":95947,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"ISrpRn5q","project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EXzsEeA5","user":{"id":"CfMhpqoJ","username":"codyhuh","name":"Cody ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46657000?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-13T22:29:19.076649Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"breezy-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar"},"mods\\SneakyCurses-v8.0.2-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"559e49325a535e6f799e029ae62c3ab586b61ada44e0cfaa24c5e487dc6eed56d3246da5c3bc24b52356c860d316094747a13b61108119df594fc1961de3fa5c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TivKCwTx","slug":"sneaky-curses","project_type":"mod","team":"ntEVwuas","title":"Sneaky Curses","description":"Obfuscates curses so you no longer know what to expect!

This datapack holds its charm by adding no new biomes, items, mobs, structures, etc... a simple datapack to just make the vanilla Nether better.\n\nAdditionally, Amplified Nether brings back the Nether mountains from the original official Minecraft Nether Update trailer. Many players saw these beautiful mountains, and were upset that they weren't in the game. 3D biomes are used extensively, with much more biome variation. Biome borders that were previously impossible are now commonplace, as any biome can border any other biome!\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:46:33.906695Z","updated":"2023-12-21T13:03:56.140906Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":60071,"followers":309,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["FBqJR2QM","sB14azEN","70trp5am","DwobyjUi","QXFvBT1u","LGRU0B5J","txd1dBMw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/1e2c39947ef738f67d7987921dee474c307707e0.png"},"version":{"id":"txd1dBMw","project_id":"wXiGiyGX","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.2.4 ~ 1.20.4","version_number":"1.2.4","changelog":"# Amplified Nether 1.2.4\n- Officially supports 1.20.3/4\n- Added empty function file for manual compat with other datapacks\n\n(I forgot to update this two weeks ago - sorry!)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-21T13:03:57.854849Z","downloads":19479,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"24d3b84cd127c74282f9d5613d67821f9fe27125","sha512":"0e3e70402f3b462e33561b1b4d5cd14311b91ccd527c6f8ff76c1fad87ae20dd213f93fb9edaeb1e5ae90afd7f0e7f5edad8366ca8e51416d8a86530b477cc3d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/versions/txd1dBMw/Amplified_Nether_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar","filename":"Amplified_Nether_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":88304,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Amplified_Nether_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar"},"mods\\Nimble-1.20.1-forge-5.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"c7df41fa95681ef8a7a222c7fa3fe1460af30754eb65dde8d71de16210ab53381bdfe3a3bb03b9774842fed5d34f77c1aa6abab77d0df85643b3d5f848e4c3e2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Q5UvqqQd","slug":"nimble","project_type":"mod","team":"uyEAjeKk","title":"Nimble","description":"Perspective animation · Auto third person · Elytra camera roll","body":"# Nimble\n\nNimble is a simple mod that adds smooth transition animation on player perspective changes.

 <summary>Text version if the thread design does not render</summary>\n\n  ## What is Almost Unified?\n  \n  The mod is inspired by the idea of UniDict. An old, no longer maintained mod from the days of 1.12.2.\n  \n  Old versions of Minecraft used a system called the Ore Dictionary. Its purpose was to make the life of modders easier when adding new resources that might exist in other mods already. When used correctly, you could use resources from various mods in their recipes interchangeably. However, if you ever played a big modpack back in the days, you probably know that there were like 10 different ingots for each material because of many mods adding them.\n  \n  This often resulted in a lack of storage space because all these resources from the different mods didn't stack. Additionally, some mods didn't use the dictionary correctly for their recipes so a lot of the resources were useless.\n  \n  UniDict solved this issue by unifying the same resources from different mods so only one item for each resource was left and could be used for all recipes. So instead of having 10 different copper ingots, you will only have one which acts as the dominant universal copper ingot.\n  \n  A lot of time has passed since 1.12.2 and the Ore Dictionary is long gone. In today's modded Minecraft, there is the tag system which acts quite similar to the Ore Dictionary. Still, they also don't solve the problem of many similar resources from different mods.\n  \n  **Almost Unified** tries to solve this by working in a similar fashion as UniDict did.<br>\n  Its goal is to have one dominant resource for each configured tag and make all recipes use this dominant entry.\n  \n  ## How does that work?\n  \n  By defining a priority mod list and target tags in the config, Almost Unified tries to find a dominant item for each entry and changes the recipes depending on that.\n  \n  In modern Minecraft, recipes are usually made of JSONs and are loaded when joining a world. Each loaded recipe is read by the mod and altered depending on different properties inside the JSON.\n  \n  For all inputs, the unification process tries to use the designated tag so all items will remain useful which means Almost Unified should also work in existing worlds.<br>\n  For outputs, Almost Unified will use the dominant item.\n  \n  Since the modification happens before the recipe is loaded by the game, there are no demanding processes going on while the game is running.\n  \n  ## What features does Almost Unified have?\n  \n  The mod transforms existing recipes to have a unified resource list that players and packmakers can work with. It doesn't add its own recipes, resources, ore generation or similar content.\n  \n  Because there is a chance to have duplicate recipes when unifying, Almost Unified will take care of duplications and remove them.<br>\n  Additionally, it hides all non-dominant entries from JEI/REI automatically.\n  \n  The mod is fully reloadable. Configs are loaded every time the unification process starts which means they can be edited on the fly. To restart the process, just rejoin the world or use the `/reload` command.\n  \n  ## Can you give an example?\n  \n  Think about having two mods (modA and modB) that both add Silver Ore. Additionally, they both add Silver Ingots and respective recipes to obtain the ingot such as blasting or smelting the ore.\n  \n  If one of those recipes doesn't accept a tag as input, Almost Unify will change that. Furthermore, it will pick one of the Silver Ingots as the dominant item depending on the mod priority list inside the `unify.json` config. The dominant Silver Ingot will then be used as output for all recipes no matter the mod.\n  \n  After the unification process, you will end up with some equal recipes. Almost Unified will merge them and change their namespace so it's visible that the recipe was changed.

or might be broken completely.  \nPlease refer to our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/12) and\n[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) for ongoing compatibility issues.  \nWhen reporting bugs, please make sure you are using the latest release of Connector and Forgified Fabric API,\nas well as **Forge 47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1\n\n### For improved compatibility with third-party APIs and libraries (REI,EMI,TR Energy), check out [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras).\n\n## 📖 About\n\nSinytra Connector is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to MinecraftForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## 📋 Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install MinecraftForge. We recommend using version **47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.\n3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.\n\nPlease note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while also getting you a fixed version ASAP.\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nSinytra Connector is, and will always remain, licensed under the MIT license.

There will be a message found within the game if the tags are \"cooked\" and more info similar to the base game can be found within the Log of the Server/Client the mod is running.\n\nThe reason behind this mod is the issue that some mod or data pack may add an invalid entry to let's say \"minecraft:mineable/pickaxe\" leading to all pickaxe mineable blocks being unmineable which breaks the game.\n\n**TLDR:** This mod prevents Mod/Datapack mistakes from breaking entire portions of the game.

you need to progress and prosper in Ad Astra!\n\n<center>\n<hr>\n\n[![Use code \"Terrarium\" for 25% off at

API","description":"Temporal API is the library for Team Temporal mods, other projects may use it as well.","body":"\nTemporal API is the official library for the Team Temporal mods other projects and modders and modpack creators may use it for their projects as much as they like.\n\nThe main goal of this mod is to make creating mods easier and more flexible!\n\nFor working with our library you need to go to build.gradle and add this:\n\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    maven {\n        url \"https://cursemaven.com\"\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"curse.maven:temporalapi-970291:<file-id>\")\n    \n    ...\n}\n```\n\nYou need to replace <file id> with file id that can be found in the end of link of needed version of the mod file.\n\nThe library for current state adds\n\nfactories,\ntag utils, \ncreative tab utils,\ntrading with villagers and wanderers customizer,\nworld features utils,\nitem properties utils,\nfov modifier\netc\nFactory and Extensions\nFactories are used to create RegistryObject objects and make their creation a lot easier.\n\nFor using ItemFactory from API you need to create ItemFactoryFacade class like here: \n\n\n```\npublic class ModItemFactoryFacade extends ItemFactory {\n    public ModItemFactoryFacade() {\n        super(ModItems.ITEMS);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso you can extend your Factory Facade with Extensions from API or create your own Extension.\n\nHere are 2 examples of using SwordExtension (with this Extension creating of Sword becomes a lot easier):\n\nLike this:\n\n\n```\npublic class ModItemFactoryFacade extends ItemFactory implements SwordExtension {\n    public ModItemFactoryFacade() {\n        super(ModItems.ITEMS);\n    }\n}\n```\nOr like this: \n```\npublic class ModItemFactoryFacade extends ItemFactory implements SwordExtension {\n    public ModItemFactoryFacade() {\n        super(ModItems.ITEMS);\n    }\n\n    public RegistryObject<SwordItem> createSword(String name, Object... args) {\n        return SwordExtension.super.createSword(name, this, args);\n    }\n\n    public RegistryObject<? extends SwordItem> createSword(String name, Supplier<? extends SwordItem> tTypedSupplier) {\n        return SwordExtension.super.createSword(name, this, tTypedSupplier);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo what about creating our object using this Facade class:\n```\npublic class ModItems {\n    public static final DeferredRegister<Item> ITEMS = DeferredRegister.create(Registries.ITEM, \"MOD_ID\");\n    public static final ModItemFactoryFacade ITEM_FACTORY = new ModItemFactoryFacade();\n\n    public static final RegistryObject<Item> MY_ITEM_1 = ITEM_FACTORY.create(\"my_item_1\");\n    public static final RegistryObject<Item> MY_ITEM_2 = ITEM_FACTORY.create(\"my_item_2\", new Item.Properties());\n    public static final RegistryObject<Item> MY_ITEM_3 = ITEM_FACTORY.create(\"my_item_3\", () -> new Item(new Item.Properties()));\n\n    //First example of creating Facade object from up\n    public static final RegistryObject<SwordItem> MY_SWORD_1 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_1\", ITEM_FACTORY, Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F);\n    public static final RegistryObject<? extends SwordItem> MY_SWORD_2 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_2\", ITEM_FACTORY, () -> new SwordItem(Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F, new Item.Properties()));\n\n\n    //Second example of creating Facade object from up\n    public static final RegistryObject<SwordItem> MY_SWORD_3 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_3\", Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F);\n    public static final RegistryObject<? extends SwordItem> MY_SWORD_4 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_4\", () -> new SwordItem(Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F, new Item.Properties()));\n}\n```\nNow lets's look on args... array. It is an array of arguments for creating an object (Will be changed in future for better readability).\n\nCurrently available Factories and extensions: \n```\nItemFactory (ArrowExtension, BowExtension, BowlExtension, MusicDiscExtension, SmithingTemplateExtension, SwordExtension, AxeExtension, PickaxeExtension, ShovelExtension, HoeExtension)\nBlockFactory (BushExtension, FlowerExtension, PottedFlowerExtension)\nParticleFactory\nEffectFactory\nPaintingFactory\nPotionFactory\nSoundEventFactory\nCreativeTabFactory\nEntityFactory\nTag Utils\nTag utils focus on tag creating and making using tags easier.\n```\nFor example if you want to create item tag you need to use ItemTagFactory:\n```\npublic class MyItemTags {\n    public static final TagFactory<Item> TAG_FACTORY = new ItemTagFactory(\"MY_MOD_ID\");\n\n    public static final TagKey<Item> MY_TAG = TAG_FACTORY.createTag(\"my_tag\");\n}\nCreative Tab Utils\nCreative tab utils are used to add items to Creative Tab that you need.\n```\nFirstly we need to go to our class that subscribed for mod events and add this function (inner part of method is just example): \n```\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void addCreativeTabs(BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent event) {\n    new SimpleTabAdder(event)\n            .addAllToTab(CreativeModeTabs.INGREDIENTS, ModItems.MY_ITEM_1, ModItems.MY_ITEM_2, ModItems.MY_ITEM_3)\n            .addAllToTab(CreativeModeTabs.COMBAT, ModItems.MY_SWORD_1, ModItems.MY_SWORD_2, ModItems.MY_SWORD_3);\n}\n```\nTrading with Villagers and Wanderers Utils\nTemporalAPI makes trading a lot easier. Here is an example of it:\n```\npublic static final TradeCustomizer tradeCustomizer = new SimpleTradeCustomizer();\n\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void customizeTradesWithVillagers(VillagerTradesEvent event) {\n    tradeCustomizer.customize(event, new VillagerTrade(\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.ANDESITE, 2),\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.EMERALD, 3),\n            new VillagerTradeDescription(\n                    VillagerProfession.ARMORER, 1, 5, 5, 0.5f\n            )\n    ));\n}\n\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void customizeTradesWithWanderers(WandererTradesEvent event) {\n    tradeCustomizer.customize(event, new WandererTrade(\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.ANDESITE, 2),\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.EMERALD, 3),\n            new WandererTradeDescription(\n                    WandererTradeDescription.TradeRarity.RARE, 5, 5, 0.5f\n            )\n    ));\n}\n```\nWorld Features Utils\nWill be expanded in the next updates.\n\nItem Properties Utils\nAdding needed properties to bows, shields, etc.\n```\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void clientSetup(final FMLClientSetupEvent event) {\n    event.enqueueWork(() -> {\n        TemporalItemProperties.makeBow(ModItems.MY_BOW_1);\n        TemporalItemProperties.makeShield(ModItems.MY_SHIELD_1);\n        TemporalItemProperties.makeCrossbow(ModItems.MY_CROSSBOW_1);\n        TemporalItemProperties.putCompostable(ModBlocks.MY_FLOWER_1, 4);\n    });\n}\n ```\nFAQ:\n \nWill This Mod Be Getting A Fabric Version:\nNo a fabric version is not planned\n \nCan I use this mod in my Modpacks:\nYes, feel free to use this mod in any modpack!\n\nHow Do I suggest features or report Bugs:\nJoin our discord above for any comments, questions, suggestions, or problems!","published":"2024-02-15T21:54:30.378738Z","updated":"2024-03-02T19:44:26.355451Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":193,"followers":1,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["G1Yppdfn","W6zu1DJy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JDtt43My/ca58bad27340df2e980bc84786a1ab5df21191c9.png"},"version":{"id":"W6zu1DJy","project_id":"JDtt43My","author_id":"mSiGS0Lf","featured":false,"name":"Temporal API 1.5.0","version_number":"1.5.0","changelog":"- Removed api.properties file\n  \n- Some changes to TemporalEngine ecosystem\n  \n- Added LegAnimationHelper","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-02T19:44:26.784364Z","downloads":116,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3e0a6a318807eca729d72147af76e5897b35d8c9","sha512":"a3cdb442238cd201319d2e2fa566a9f4e76d6996760674296a7e475441026e56c0d73cd6d61faba17019de11f66f7feafe37e1715b4807fdc99dfcab94d3922b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JDtt43My/versions/W6zu1DJy/temporalapi-1.5.0.jar","filename":"temporalapi-1.5.0.jar","primary":true,"size":135295,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Ob3vLyNs","user":{"id":"mSiGS0Lf","username":"Cyber_Rat","name":"Thorny Ron","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/mSiGS0Lf/ca58bad27340df2e980bc84786a1ab5df21191c9.png","bio":null,"created":"2024-02-05T19:24:05.533195Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"temporalapi-1.5.0.jar"},"mods\\betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar":{"sha512":"c30688f402b39bad8c2f6f6fdb9c541416c9bf8ad849602fcfe29b19582c3869e6b68e2ca6b7b9ec1f2e7edb28425815536f7e7de1064a0ab6d9e11111eb0cfb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"tPLE214j","slug":"betterdays","project_type":"mod","team":"hurffenI","title":"Better Days","description":"Gives you control over the passage of time by allowing you to customize the length of the day-night cycle and alters the Minecraft sleep mechanic by accelerating the speed of time.","body":"A Minecraft 1.19+ mod to designed to extend the length of the crazy short minecraft day.\n\n## Notice\n\nThis mod was originally designed as a 1.15.2 mod. However, due to being too\nbusy to update to 1.16.5,\n[Hourglass](https://github.com/DuckyCrayfish/hourglass) mod was created. Now\nHourglass hasn't received any updates in nearly a year, plus there are new\nfeatures that needed added. I've revived Better days to update for not only\n1.19 and 1.20, but also bring all the features to <u>both</u> **Forge and Fabric**.\n\n1.19+ is a fork of Hourglass mod, with new features and some functionality removed.\n\n1.18.2 is a backport for both Forge and Fabric that contains all of the 1.19+ features and bug fixes.\n\n### Differences from Hourglass Mod\n * Commands removed.\n * Forge only configuration screen removed.\n * Syncing config updates with client. Now requires a restart.\n * Added better support for Serene Seasons\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod (optionally) **replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition\nto morning** by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass\nfaster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for\nany sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the\nduration of the night.\n\nBetter Days allows for **customization of the day-night cycle duration**, and can control day and night\nspeed independently. Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make\na day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more\nforgiving experience.\n\nBetter Days also provides a number of **time effects** that may speed up the progression of various\nelements in Minecraft to match the current speed of time. Some examples include crop growth, grass\ngrowth, weather, potion effects, furnaces, hoppers, etc. Most of these time effects are disabled by\ndefault but can be enabled by setting their associated [config options](#configuration).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nBetter Days is compatible with the following mods:\n\n* [Homeostatic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/homeostatic)\n* [Ready Player Fun](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ready-player-fun)\n* [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)\n* [Sleep Warp](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sleep-warp)\n  * If mod is installed, sleep system is disabled.\n* [Fabric Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-seasons)\n* [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons)\n* [Enhanced Celestials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-celestials)\n* [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark)  \n  * The Improved Sleeping module of Quark interferes with the sleep feature of Better Days.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)  \n  * The \"Nerf Clock\" Quark option breaks the bed clock in Better Days. Either the Quark tweak should\n    be disabled or the Better Days Bed Clock should be disabled via the `displayBedClock` config.\n* [Nomadic Tents](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nomadic-tents)\n  * Better Days is compatible with this mod. However, sleep causes an extra full day cycle to pass\n    after waking.\n\n#### Sleep Vote Mods\n\nBetter Days is compatible with mods that enable sleep voting or have sleep percentage systems like\nQuark and Morpheus, but they conflict with the sleep feature of this mod. These features should\neither be disabled in their corresponding mods, or the sleep feature in Better Days should be disabled.\nThe sleep feature can be disabled via command or file by modifying the `enableSleepFeature` option.\n\n#### Other Compatibility Notes\n\nThe Overworld is currently the only dimension supported. However, most dimensions in Minecraft\n(including custom dimensions) derive their time information from the Overworld and will therefore\nelapse time at the same rate.\n\nThis mod does not save data to world files and can safely be safely removed from a Minecraft","published":"2023-07-27T22:05:48.640506Z","updated":"2023-08-17T18:20:33.690463Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":11298,"followers":69,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["ppTvMkcQ","6QftivWi","TddICzRK","VaNOkVJS","VdjYMDVE","ibKtyTIG","9oJK1FwS","Dghw70lA","qFEeN1Wp","o8hjQvLV","wywWx0Ub","xUcSpIZd","Mqwb9p92","TzICWvRb","JzqHlPKT","5hMNExru","TSERS24K","5yfcESSM","Vz8xARIh","e1jJjulH","chsCXxGC","byzCvNSG","5doFox3Y","ftsoxL1c","EC94faYu","LmJGq8Ff","7eS9eKJN","McOXQE2j","MSEo61mh","CEKbQT8h","IOxiu3gK","2EB4O0kI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPLE214j/a808b6d89eddc9acc0f9c99c67f47643502afa34.webp"},"version":{"id":"2EB4O0kI","project_id":"tPLE214j","author_id":"lY1GdMaR","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE","version_number":"1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE","changelog":"Git Changelog Better Days Mod\n\nVersion 1.20.1-3.1.0.3\n\n - Release 1.20.1-3.1.0.3\n - Disable Serene Seasons fix by default.\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-17T18:20:34.973750Z","downloads":2302,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c30688f402b39bad8c2f6f6fdb9c541416c9bf8ad849602fcfe29b19582c3869e6b68e2ca6b7b9ec1f2e7edb28425815536f7e7de1064a0ab6d9e11111eb0cfb","sha1":"935e513d1e796556c58d796228d6ffeaba6b15f9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPLE214j/versions/2EB4O0kI/betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar","filename":"betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar","primary":true,"size":522254,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"SaCpeal4","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hurffenI","user":{"id":"lY1GdMaR","username":"wendall911","name":"Wendall Cada","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44465?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-28T15:20:50.298202Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar"},"mods\\nerb-1.20.1-0.3-FORGE.jar":{"sha512":"be46225ec0a8636799605b1369c60bd6f150c428982d3b7f0d0b2ca114aa7f1a77658c6763f1d678d184d02213c6cb617c20607b8f445e47c4d947838db89d9c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"bQh7xzFq","slug":"nerb","project_type":"mod","team":"20Vhjk7o","title":"Not Enough Recipe Book [NERB]","description":"Completely removes recipe book from the game, optimizing player data.","body":"This mod was created for only one simple purpose - completely remove recipe book from the game.

It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>.

The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Make sure to test your results to see if you require it.\n\n## About\n\nSimplified AI modification mod focused on performance and low-level modifications to AIs in the game. Picking up the slack for the base game and improving it for a modded ecosystem. Handling common problems such as too many animals, performance hits from swarms of zombies, and simple remove tasks skipped by larger AI improvement mods.\n\n## Story\n\nAI Improvements was born out of the need to improve server performance for large heavily modded servers. As any experienced server owner will know a server's CPU clock time is eaten away by mods all trying to fight over resources. Most server owners and developers will try to attack this problem by trimming mods. Rather than going after the mods installed I started to look at Minecraft itself. Focusing down on how it was designed to work and how it lent to performance problems.\n\nI found that as a server's population grows so does the amount of entities and other resources. At first, I thought \"lets reduce the spawn rate of mobs on the server\" this lead to a complaint about mob farming. Even with testing, it didn't show a major solution to the problem. So rather than taking that approach, I decided to improve how the AI's function. This resulted in a lot of resource and insight into different areas. After many hours, I found my solution and created this mod. \n\n## FAQ \n\n<ins>I installed but didn't see a large gain as promised?</ins>\\\nNewer versions of MC implement fixes for the AI. With the last few versions, the rotation fix was implemented in addition to other fixes. Thus, the impact of this mod is much lower than in older versions.\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the server only?</ins>\\\nYes, the mod is coded to function without it being client side\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the client only?</ins>\\\nYes, though it may not do much to improve fps. \n\n<ins>Where is the config?</ins>\\\n`.minecraft/config/bbm/AI_Improvements.cfg`\n\n<ins>What will happen if I disable the EntityLookHelper replacement?</ins>\\\nYou're not going to see much of an improvement in the AI code. However, if you enabled the other disable configs it should be fine.\n\n<ins>How does this mod work for fixing performance?</ins>\\\nIt depends on the feature and version of Minecraft. Most of the performance comes from caching heavily calculated values. This has the result of reducing CPU time at the cost of an ignorable amount of RAM. See feature list for exacts...\n\n## Current Features:\n\n### Config to disable AI Watch Closest Entity\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. When changed to true it will remove an AI segment called EntityAIWatchClosest. This AI segment handles the coded AIs use to rotate their head towards a nearby entity.Visually this will cause a few odd issues. However, for the CPU this frees up a lot of usage caused by entities. \n\n### Config to disable AI look random, config is not enabled by default\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. Setting the config to true will cause entities to no longer use the 'look idle' AI code. This can improve performance for servers will large populations. As almost every entity on the map will use this when not doing anything important. Visually this can cause the entities head to not rotate sometimes but mostly goes unnoticed.\n\n### Config to replace EntityLookHelper with a more efficient version, config is enabled by default\n\nThis is the main feature of the mod and can greatly improve CPU performance at a small cost to RAM. How this works is MC's look helper code is replaced with a custom version. The custom version stores some data that makes it faster to get the angle for a location. Threw some testing with VisualVM result have shown a 50% to 80% decrease in CPU usage by the AI code. For a server with 25 people on constantly this resulted in a gain from 5 to 7 tps. ","published":"2023-04-16T18:51:48.421272Z","updated":"2023-11-20T12:57:53.791109Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":78276,"followers":76,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["tSHaOkjT","eJihmpNQ","WfWIqNar","FXloZ58B"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DSVgwcji/819dbaeb9b0dac8250a1403d1db7e7646f9a9b8f.png"},"version":{"id":"eJihmpNQ","project_id":"DSVgwcji","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-0.5.2","version_number":"0.5.2","changelog":"-

**[ForgetMeChunk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgetmechunk)**\n- **[ChunkSavingFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-saving-fix)**\n-

[Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) -

Supplementaries.","body":"\nFOR FORGE/FABRIC 1.19.2, 1.18.2, & 1.20.1\n\n![This is an image](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/IntegratedStronghold/BH_NU_HEADER.webp)\n\nRequired Mods:\n\nIntegrated API \n\nCreate\n\nSupplementaries\n\nQuark (forge only)\n\n\n\n\nOptional Integrated Mods:\n\nBiomes You'll Go\n\nBiomes O' Plenty\n\nWaystones\n\nFarmer's

needed)\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\nWHAT IS INTEGRATED STRONGHOLD?\n   \n\nIntegrated Stronghold is the second mod in the Integrated Structure series (the first being IDAS). Not only does it completely overhaul the boring old Minecraft stronghold structure with tons of heavily detailed rooms to explore, but it integrates Supplementaries/Quark decorations and Create mod doors, puzzles, traps, and more. It is the biggest generated structure dungeon you have ever explored, it takes up the maximum size possible in Minecraft. Additionally, it greatly expands upon the lore of the stronghold in Minecraft through lore books found in chests. I got sick of installing structure mods into a pack and roaming the world, only to find vanilla items and nothing of difficulty anywhere. I love detailed builds and Create machines, so I decided to make mods that adds exactly what I’ve been missing. Beautiful and challenging dungeons and structures packed with lore that are fully integrated into multiple core mods.\n\n\nIt is compatible with other stronghold mods (such as Yung's Better Strongholds) but it is HIGHLY recommended you only use this mod to preserve the integrated feeling and original intent.\n\n\nI HIGHLY RECCOMEND USING ONE OR ALL OF THE OPTIONAL DATAPACKS TO ADD UNIQUE MOBS AND COMBAT\n\n[Trailer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUFqx_kgi1c)\n\nConfiguration and optional Integration:\n\nTo enable optional integration, download these datapacks\n\nEnd Remastered\nAlex's Mobs\nThe Graveyard\nDungeons Mobs\nIf there is a mobs mod you want integrated, let me know!\n \n\nTo configure anything else, download this datapack\n\nTo change the spawn rate, change the spacing and separation in the structures set file. Spacing is the Average distance between two neighboring generation attempts. Value between 0 and 4096\nSeparation is the Minimum distance in chunks between two neighboring attempts. Value between 0 and 4096. Can't be bigger than spacing\nTo edit biomes, edit the biome files in tags/worldgen/biome/has structure\nTo change what mobs spawn throughout the structure, edit the integrated_structure_spawners files. Adding mobs to these is fairy straightforward, take a look at one of the optional datapacks if you need an example\n \n\nNote: To use datapacks on a server, I recommend using a global datapack mod or KubeJS\n\n \n\nFeatures:\n\nOver 50 unique heavily detailed dungeon rooms making the experience different every time:\n\n-  Unique small and detailed rooms including study rooms, kitchens, armories, mines, and more\n\n-  Massive rooms to explore and uncover the secrets of including the portal room, grand library, dining hall, and more\n\n-  Medium sized rooms such as prisons, fountains, enchanting rooms, portal rooms, and more\n\n-  Tons of variations of trapped hallways to keep you on your toes\n\n-  2 Custom made music discs by Cama to breath life into the stronghold. One can be found be crafting disc fragments found in the stronghold.\n\n-  Lore books hidden in chests expanded upon the Minecraft lore greatly and giving the stronghold a true backstory and purpose in your world, while still leaving room for the player to piece together it's history.\n\n-  Customized loot, weapons, and tools matching the lore books.\n\n-  Create mod puzzles and traps to navigate\n\n- Join my discord to make suggestions and influence my future projects!\n\n \n\nIf you have trouble finding the stronghold, use Eye of Enders to locate it or use \"/locate integrated_stronghold:stronghold\"\n\n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQ: What biome mods are compatible?\n\nA: Most biome mods are compatible including Terralith, BOP, and BYG.\n\n \n\nQ: Why are there so many dependencies?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\nQ: Will you backport/update to ___?\n\nA: I will always keep the mod up to date with the newest versions of Minecraft as the dependencies update. I am also currently working on the port to fabric\n\n \n\nQ: Does this mod work with other structures mods?\n\nA: Yes all of Yung's mods, Repurposed Structures and more will all work but it is HIGHLY recommended you only use this Stronghold overhaul mod. YUNG's Stronghold is good but the detail and integration put into this mod makes it miles more immersive and a better experience overall without question in my opinion. If you don't believe me try it out for yourself!\n\n \n\nQ: Can I use this mod in a modpack?\n\nA: Yes! I would love it if this mod gets used in packs.\n\n \n\nQ: Can this mod be only on the server-side?\nA: No, due to its custom music discs and soundtrack\n\n \n\nQ: What features from Quark can be disabled? \n\nA: All of the technical changes and Redstone can be disabled without problem. IDAS uses all the building blocks though.\n\n \n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nMy Patrons!!!\n\nHowester1984 who helped me build the stronghold!\n\nCama, the author of the incredible music disc you find in the mod\n\nThe Bisect Hosting team and especially Perz for making the logo for this mod!\n\nMegRae, I used her tutorial to build the hanging dragon chandelier in the portal room.\n\nTelepathicGrunt, the author of Repurposed Structures. I used the files from their mod a ton for coding references.\n\nYUNGNICKYOUNG for his jigsaw manager.\n\nMy cat Fonzy for sitting on my lap while I coded this entire thing. Having weights on your lap really helps you stay focused\n\n \n\nJoin the Discord by clicking on the image or link below if you run into an issue of any kind or have a suggestion, I'll try my best to respond to everyone and would absolutely love suggestions!

The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum.net\n- 9minecraft.net\n- ign.com\n- 8minecraft.com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot.it\n- minecraft-inside.ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it

Preview","description":"Allows you to preview a map / seed in the new world screen","body":"# World Preview\n\n*World Preview* is a mod for visualizing Minecraft world seeds before they are generated.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust download the latest *World Preview* JAR file for your ***exact*** Minecraft version.\nAdditionally, ***always*** ensure that you are using the correct version for your modloader (Fabric/Forge).\nThen save the downloaded jar to the `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance.\n\nFinally, if you are on Fabric you also need to download the\n[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).\n\n## Usage\n\n*World Preview* adds a new `Preview` tab to the Singleplayer menu.\n\n<img alt=\"biomes\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/open.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nUpon opening that tab, a random seed is selected and a map of biomes is generated:\n\n<img alt=\"biomes\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/biomes.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nBy default, the overworld dimension will be generated, structures will not be shown and no heightmap will be generated.\nThis can be changed in the Settings (top-left button in the `Preview` tab).\n\nWhen structure sampling is enabled, the visibility of individual types of structures on the preview can be toggled:\n\n<img alt=\"structures\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/structures.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nWhen height sampling is enabled, the preview can be toggled between the biome map and a colorized heightmap:\n\n<img alt=\"heightmap\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/heightmap.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nWhen y-layer intersection sampling is enabled, the preview can also show the blocks on the current y-layer.\nAdditionally, the y-layer one step below is also shown in a lighter color:\n\n<img alt=\"heightmap\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/y-int.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nSince version 1.1.0, there is also experimental support for opening the preview in-game for a single-player worlds:\n\n<img alt=\"ingame\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/ingame.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n##### Moving on the preview\n\nClicking and dragging on the map-part of the preview tab will move along the x and z axis.\nThis will cause the following load sequence:\n- Any biomes that are not yet sampled on the current y-level\n- Structures (if enabled)\n- Height map (if enabled)\n- Adjacent y-layers (if enabled)\n\nScrolling does **not** zoom into the map (there is a separate setting in the configuration menu for controlling the zoom level), but instead travels along the y-axis.\nThis allows cave biomes to be seen as well. Please note that non-cave biomes span the entire world height beyond that.\n\n##### Other features\n\n- Works with mods! Tested with:\n  - Terralith\n  - Biomes O' Plenty\n- Persistent seed storage\n- Highlighting specific biomes\n- Highly configurable and extendable\n\n## Supported version\n\nThis table shows the current support status for the Minecraft version.\n\n| Minecraft Version | Status    |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| `1.20.x`          | Supported |\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q:** *Will Minecraft versions before 1.20 be supported?*\n\n**A:** No.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *Scrolling does not zoom the preview!*\n\n**A:** Scrolling moves the y-level up and down. To change the zoom level, go to `Settings (top left wrench) -> Resolution` and change the visual size of a chunk.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *The preview is completely white / black for the y-intersections view.*\n\n**A:** This is likely because the starting y-layer for the preview is the build limit. Try scrolling down to a lower y-layer and something should show up.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *My CPU is at 100%!*\n\n**A:** You can limit the number of used cores in `Settings (top left wrench) -> General`. By default, *World Preview* tries to compute the biome preview / structures / heightmap as quickly as possible. These calculations require a lot of CPU power.\n\n\n\n## Mod incompatibilities\n\nThis mod should be compatible with most mods (including those adding new biomes and dimensions).\n\n### TerraFirmaCraft (TFC)\n\nWorld Preview **is** compatible with TFC, however, there is a known issue:\n\nThe Y intersections view will always be a white screen for all Y levels with TFC, because the `TFCChunkGenerator` has a dummy implementation for the [`getBaseColumn`](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft/blob/v3.1.2-beta/src/main/java/net/dries007/tfc/world/TFCChunkGenerator.java#L643-L646) method.\n\nTo clarify: This doesn't mean that TFC is broken / does something wrong (it clearly works on its own and does its job).\nIt just means that TFC does not provide the specific information World Preview needs in this case.\n\n## Adding support for new biomes and structures\n\nNew biomes, structures, and more can be registered via the Minecraft datapack mechanism. See [the World Preview dataformat docs](https://github.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/blob/1.20/DataFormats.md) for more information.\n","published":"2023-07-20T17:55:05.364950Z","updated":"2024-02-14T16:59:59.794519Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":14147,"followers":169,"categories":["utility","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["tjqMno0Q","D5XR5WmI","uMb9JQJJ","EYQTvcon","q8cp8Up8","KcOX4y1R","lrmzvajm","LfhhSGYb","AgDtzd65","WsxbjtV1","5dgT6Hzz","nSPYf7G7","urkq3DFQ","o1bxdh0N","Q94LMYhZ","8myO4JQ4","JJzfHWi8","3ypYT1wx","M4Ec8lMV","r1xyx71y","VxQspdgZ","j2jo2y0K","5W28SUks","Pob15K1q","40gp6QRO","9Xsy36AH","iAgxbkcC","5Ibk6yb4","9eJezYnQ","weSRpaMI","6g6HM0rx","ulplldFu","gisvN9Ni","391LqFNJ","6y1WrZlx","QEXJAQgM","k7Zr1mo0","lSCY5eo1","N4QTQdRQ","DORsov6y","Kj0zM7Oj","AMpckQBu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WtfpyicL/d3abefcbeb5849d7744c71b09fe97e79e6f0362d.png"},"version":{"id":"k7Zr1mo0","project_id":"WtfpyicL","author_id":"ywiTouYP","featured":false,"name":"World

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

Not only can you finally give them something to hold in survival mode, you can also freely configure all body parts to pose armor stands as you please. And that's not all! There is a set of built-in poses to choose from, a settings panel for various properties of armor stands, and also great tools for positioning the armor stand, even in ways where you can use it to only display items. And best of all: This mod works on servers without it! You'll need operator rights though. And when the mod is installed on both client and server, all players can use it freely without any permission requirement. Also a few additional features will become accessible.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To use the handy new screen added by Armor Statues, you'll have to shift + right-click an armor stand placed in the world. This will open the last screen you were using. Switch to different screens using the tabs to the left. Quickly switch between those tabs by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Rotations Screen</strong> allows you to freely move around head, body, both arms and both legs. Rotation values are restricted to a certain range to prevent weird rotations. To unlock this restriction, simply click the lock icon to move sliders on the full range of 360 degrees. When moving the sliders with your cursor isn't precise enough, try clicking a slider first, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around with greater accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The screen also offers buttons for reseting the current pose, for creating a random pose, and also two buttons for copying the current pose and pasting it elsewhere. You can only copy one pose at a time.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The next screen is the <strong>Poses Screen</strong>. Here you are offered a selection of bult-in poses to choose from. After selecting a pose you can also go back to the rotations screen to customize that pose. Built-in poses are the same as found on Bedrock Edition, so you might already be familir with them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Style Screen</strong> gives access to some of the basic armor stand options. You can also set a name, which will show above the armor stand, directly in the gui, so you don't have to use a name tag. The <i>Sealed</i> option is only available to creative mode players.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Position Screen</strong> allows you to place the armor stand with great precision, you can also change the rotation. To be able to better see how you're rotating/moving the armor stand around, click the magnifying glass button to hide most screen elements and give you a clear view. When moving the armor stand around a lot it probably is a good idea to disable its gravity on the style screen.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Alignments Screen</strong> is directly taken from the <a href=\"https://vanillatweaks.net/\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>VanillaTweaks</strong></span></a> <i>Armor Statues</i> data pack. Here you can position an item or block held by the armor stand, and also hide the armor stand, so the item/block appears only by itself.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finally the <strong>Equipment Screen</strong> gives you access to the armor stands equipment slots via a menu.

When not present on the server, Armor Statues sends vanilla commands to the server to change armor stand values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version!

Most of the features are also configurable!\n\n## ⭐Features\n* **Parrying**! Time your blocks just right and perform a parry, pushing back enemies and flinging back projectiles.\n* **Pummeling**, a new enchantment that increases parry knockback.\n* **Barbed**, a new enchantment which applies thorns onto your shield.\n* The **Netherite Shield**! A tough shield that's more durable, fire resistant, and grants some knockback resistance.\n* **Shield Trims!** The Netherite Shield utilizes armor trims, instead of banners for cosmetics.\n* **Instantaneous Blocking**! Shields will now block quicker, similar to the Combat Test snapshots.\n\n## 👏 Contributors\n* Thanks to [Outer Cloud](https://modrinth.com/user/outercloudstudio) for creating the logo!\n* Thanks to [Chikorita Lover](https://modrinth.com/user/Chikorita-Lover) for their contributions to the Netherite Shield!\n* Thanks to [XKZGx](https://twitter.com/MEGATREX4) for Ukrainian localisations!\n\n## 🌐 Server Hosting\n[![ABODE CODE](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1073307867953770578/1099044348605239436/ABODE.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=110)\n","published":"2022-04-09T18:18:59.830268Z","updated":"2024-01-19T17:54:08.978378Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":81936,"followers":156,"categories":["adventure","equipment","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["efZmKKOv","cu3ZpTlr","A9POgeVZ","Sk8lzARm","mRWzuN0d","RNq4dSva","qI2QGxUx","1hJuekS7","zz7EL9j5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aV1COQ7a/06f546fee278185cbd142b93ca7e60feed017020.png"},"version":{"id":"1hJuekS7","project_id":"aV1COQ7a","author_id":"IPtYpg1C","featured":false,"name":"Guarding 1.20.1 - 2.3.3","version_number":"2.3.3","changelog":"* Added a shield icon to the Smithing Table interface.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-12T19:52:16.174615Z","downloads":48698,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d1f04b33eda3940192d262ba5eb672829c2f506a","sha512":"bb74342e160a5f9bb2951eee3d84124e60e73bf570b96574eb363b005cf3e850c080f73130f73f3ead945f63ae4dcbff644ef21dc22e534264c6e7c20c95c69b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aV1COQ7a/versions/1hJuekS7/guarding-2.3.3.jar","filename":"guarding-2.3.3.jar","primary":true,"size":328468,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"iTOj0tRW","user":{"id":"ztEuFGq2","username":"outercloudstudio","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60296487?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-03-29T02:09:07.648117Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Logo Creator","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"guarding-2.3.3.jar"},"mods\\everycomp-1.20-2.6.35.jar":{"sha512":"174447e56f1c3337286ec3e3dbfab96e8ae4fa28979aa37d8a58922afd3e3889e55a45a48142014216dc3bbeaa85510a882b92876871d3dcfe05aca15ac61031","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"eiktJyw1","slug":"every-compat","project_type":"mod","team":"PvjDK7su","title":"Every Compat (Wood Good)","description":"Universal Wood Compat: Quark, Twilight Forest, Twigs, Another Furniture, Farmers Delight, Macaw's,  Valhelsia, Architects Palette, Deco Blocks, Crayfish FM","body":"<center>\n\n## Every Compat: Wood Good\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/qdKRTDf8Cv\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/790151253144895508?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Discord&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Discord\"></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/mehvahdjukaar\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=mehvahdjukaar&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/Supplementariez\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Supplementariez?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitter&message=Twitter&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Youtube&message=Twitter&logoColor=ff0000\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nTired of incomplete wood sets? Well you came to the right place!\n\nThis Mod serves as an addon to many popular mods and is meant to fill in the gaps by adding all the blocks that such mods add in all wood types currently installed.\n\nEvery block type added is available in ALL wood types.\n\nWith this mod you won't need extra compatibility addons and instead only rely on a single universal one! It's all automatic!\n\nAdditionally the mod will try to convert any block from other uninstalled compat mods into its equivalent ones.\n\n<center>\n\n## 🪑 Supported Blocks🪑\n</center>\n\n### Quark\n- Posts\n- Stripped posts\n- Hedges\n- Bookshelves\n- Vertical Planks\n- Ladders\n- Chests\n\n### Farmers Delight\n- Cabinets\n\n### Twilight Forest\n- Hollow Logs\n- Banisters\n\n### Decorative Blocks\n- Seats\n- Palisades\n- Supports\n- Beams\n\n### Architects Palette\n- Boards\n- Railings\n\n### Valhesia Structures\n- Posts\n- Cut Posts\n\n### Another Furniture\n- Tables\n- Chairs\n- Shelves\n- Flower Boxes\n- Shutters\n- Drawers\n- Benches\n\n### Storage Drawers\n- Drawers\n\n### Furnish\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Builders and Craft Additions\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Mosaic Carpentry\n- Mosaics\n\n### MrCrayfish Furniture Mod\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Twigs\n- Tables\n\n### Macaw's Mods\n- Fences\n- Windows\n- Bridges\n- Lights\n- Paths\n- Furnitures\n- Rooves\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓ F. A. Q. ❓\n</center>\n\nQ: How the heck does this work?\n> A: Magic.\n\nQ: Is this compatible with other compat mods?\n> A: Yes, I've included a list of many popular compat mods. The mod will do its best not to register stuff that's already in them when they are installed\n\nQ: I'm a mod author, could I use this mod to add support to my blocks?\n> A: Yes! The mod includes a very simple and easy to use API with which modders can register an entire block definition in only 10 lines! The mod will automatically generate all assets automatically\n\nQ: Can you add support for \"x\" wood type?\n> A: Go try the mod\n\nQ: A block type isnt supported, can I add it myself?\n> A: Not directly as registration cant be conditional and cant depend on config files. If you are a modder and know code you can make a pull request to the mod or use the EveryCompatAPI class directly in your mods (check their javadocs & mod modules for info)\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

I got sick of installing structure mods into a pack and roaming the world, only to find vanilla items and nothing of difficulty anywhere. I love detailed builds and Create machines, so I decided to make a mod that adds exactly what I’ve been missing. Beautiful and challenging dungeons and structures packed with lore that are fully integrated into multiple core forge mods.\n \n\nIf you’re new to this mod I highly recommend locating a Labyrinth, Tinker’s Workshop, Ancient Mines or a Pillager Fortress and playing through it. Those took by FAR the most time to build and I believe they are genuinely very fun and rewarding. Good luck!\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n    This version of the mod is not complete. There are a ton of planned features and the structure's code and looks will be tuned up over time. It also probably has some bugs. Report them in the built in issue tracker or let me know on discord!\n\nFeatures\n\nOver 50 unique heavily detailed structures in the Overworld and Nether dimensions including:\n\n-  20 unique small and detailed world building structures such as campsites, markets, animal dens, and more\n\n-  5 Endgame level dungeons ranging from expansive dwarven mines to the desert Labyrinth to the Pillager Fortress\n\n-  Create themed Dungeons with spinning death traps such as the Tinker's Workshop\n\n-  15 unique houses and inns for weary travelers\n\n - 6 magical wizard and enchanting towers to explore\n\n-  Sunken pirate ships\n\n-  Villager Castles\n\n-  Magic towers and portals to explore in the nether\n\n-  Event based structures such as the Winter Wagon and Haunted Manor\n\n \n\nPlanned Features:\n\n \n\n- Underground dungeon variants\n\n- More Nether and End structures\n\n- Join my discord to make suggestions and vote on what structures get added next!\n\n \n\nIf you have trouble finding one of these structures, just start typing `/locate idas` into the chat and you should find a list of all the structures. For example, typing `/locate idas:castle` will find the closest Castle to your location.\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: What biome mods are compatible?\n\nA: Most biome mods are compatible including Terralith, BOP, and BYG.\n\n\nQ: Why are there so many dependencies?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\nQ: Will you backport/update to ___?\n\nA: I will always keep the mod up to date with the newest versions of Minecraft as the dependencies update\n\n\nQ: Does this mod work with other structures mods?\n\nA: Yes all of Yung's mods, Repurposed Structures and more will all work with zero issue. \n\n\nQ: Can I use this mod in a modpack?\n\nA: Yes! I would love it if this mod gets used in packs.\n\n \nQ: Can this mod be only on the server-side?\nA: No, due to its custom music discs and soundtrack, and changes to client side structure blocks\n\n\nQ: For everyone who wants to live in the structures: How do I get mobs to stop spawning?\n\nA: Try using the Magnum Torch Mod\n\n \nQ: What features from Quark can be disabled? \n\nA: All of the technical changes and Redstone can be disabled without problem. IDAS uses all the building blocks though.\n\n \nQ: What mobs from Alex's Mobs are used? \n\nA: IDAS uses a lot of the mobs including Skelewag, Murmur, Cave Centipede, Rocky Roller, Dropbear, Bear, Crocodile, Crimson Mosquito, Frilled Shark, Snapping Turtle, Flutter, Bison, Underminer\n\n\nI’ve spent over 300 hours building and coding this mod.

Think two Dinnerbone cows being bred, the new baby cow will also be a Dinnerbone cow now automatically.\n\nIf two animals have names that are different when bred, their names will be cut into halves, and stitched back together. So a Dinnerbone and a jeb_ sheep could make a sheep named Dinneb_, or a sheep named jerbone.\n\nIf one or neither of the animals bred have a nametag, nothing special happens.\n\n## Interested? Here's some more in bullet point form\n\n* Two mobs with nametags being bred will produce an offspring also containing a nametag. If they both have the same name it will propagate to the offspring, otherwise a mix of the two names will.\n* This mod works on multiplayer servers without clients needing to download it\n* This said,

Until the Gipple is added, this mod will have to suffice.\n\n---\n\n### Gipples are elusive creatures.\nGipples can be found dwelling within colonies inside caves. These colonies are very rare, but spawn more commonly under colder biomes and oceans. Inside of Gipple colonies, you can find the new gelatin blocks, gelatin layers, as well as the gelatite and amoebalith stone types! You'll find Gipples slumbering within blocks of gelatin. Break the blocks to awaken them.\n\n---\n\n### Gipples love to eat glow lichen.\nBe it in block or item form, glow lichen is the Gipple's source of food. After eating, Gipples can produce gelatin layers, which can be harvested for tasty gelatin you can eat! However, if you feed a Gipple more glow lichen before it has the chance to produce gelatin, it will divide itself into 2 baby Gipples.\n\n*(Note: Beware, on the rare occasion that an unforeseen turn of events takes place during gipplication, it is strongly advised to evacuate the area and never come back.)*\n\n---\n\n","published":"2023-10-16T14:49:40.743392Z","updated":"2023-11-23T22:32:38.025854Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":3267,"followers":53,"categories":["mobs"],"additional_categories":["adventure","food","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["NLteDoEC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QYfKDJOV/90fd057390e92ff7383dfb5dcda7a575fe1b2b2d.png"},"version":{"id":"NLteDoEC","project_id":"QYfKDJOV","author_id":"TWxZU0Eb","featured":false,"name":"Gipples Galore 1.0.0","version_number":"1.0.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-23T22:32:39.535998Z","downloads":3266,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9a1d7dbd3eb63a4766da844f87b365ac5849d5edfa3eeb47181df0a3f63b44c544b3cdabc45a83eac0d68f81c7522ece2229fea6a7a1247a2c3da0ad9c4aa64e","sha1":"8f58894e8f607434be9401ca256ebbfd1bdeeb6d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QYfKDJOV/versions/NLteDoEC/gipples_galore-1.20.1-1.0.0.jar","filename":"gipples_galore-1.20.1-1.0.0.jar","primary":true,"size":1855959,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"XA0535Le","user":{"id":"heQFUuog","username":"KingRolly","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108255296?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-27T06:06:47.796993Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"XA0535Le","user":{"id":"Mts2q4yj","username":"hhumanoid","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Mts2q4yj/409ac9b818766f1a135c90f58b23ca1a09a3df94.png","bio":"hi im humanoid and im humanoid","created":"2022-05-19T22:10:35.497705Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Animator/Sound Designer/Gipple Wrangler","ordering":0},{"team_id":"XA0535Le","user":{"id":"lqaqtNCa","username":"monozari1","name":"Monozari","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/lqaqtNCa/8a8e5a90b546ad545e2c204b466e7c5a8ce86fb6.webp","bio":null,"created":"2023-08-11T21:01:54.643482Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Team Jelly Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"XA0535Le","user":{"id":"jU16tlVR","username":"digitalpear","name":"DP","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49123882?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-04-30T23:29:00.273057Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Programmer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"XA0535Le","user":{"id":"TWxZU0Eb","username":"uraneptus","name":"Uraneptus","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TWxZU0Eb/abd88d3736a45e6a66607d27bae6548a0b523687.png","bio":"Hey I'm a Minecraft Modder","created":"2021-04-07T16:36:03.570383Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Programmer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"gipples_galore-1.20.1-1.0.0.jar"},"mods\\libIPN-forge-1.20-4.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"7a2fd507f41c5e7ae4dbc5aa298a28fba2bf4589df815b6d9e0e8cbda54d5d61eb21aacf61322403922fb603af7b124d39e270e55fb2b95fd846269aa03a8714","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"onSQdWhM","slug":"libipn","project_type":"mod","team":"MgFPekwM","title":"libIPN","description":"Inventory Profiles Next GUI/Config library","body":"## Description \nThis is the GUI/Config library used by Inventory Profiles Next \n\nThis lib will be shared between IPN and Any future mod I make\n\n## FAQ\n\nCan I use it in my mods?\n\nFeel free to use it, but at this point there is no documentation or examples.

As long as you stay more than 16 blocks away from a creeper, it will never come to blow you up. Since mobs do not spawn within 24 blocks of the player, this means it is easy to survive: just stay still and there is only a minuscule chance a mob will wander close enough.\n\nNo more of that. By default, this mod increases the follow range of every hostile mob to at least 32 blocks, making the game a lot harder. This behaviour is fully configurable from the config. Not only can the minimum range of all hostile mobs be changed this way, you can even override individual mob types. Want all skeletons to be snipers that can spot you from a hundred blocks away? Do you prefer zombies to be so blind you have to literally bump into them? The power is yours!\n \nThis mod is entirely server-sided and is not required on the client side.\n\n \n\nNote that only newly-spawned mobs are affected. Mobs that were already in the world before you installed the mod or changed the config will not be affected.","published":"2022-09-12T09:29:27.077140Z","updated":"2024-02-26T13:15:45.869725Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":9314,"followers":19,"categories":["game-mechanics","mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gCOowkr0","cBbVgZbj","r1B1Grk8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/eEpWUjwq/80a92c930fca6827e2fa9e35329cc56688e1e664.png"},"version":{"id":"cBbVgZbj","project_id":"eEpWUjwq","author_id":"nzHM76iA","featured":false,"name":"Farsighted Mobs (Forge) 1.1 (1.20.1)","version_number":"1.1","changelog":"- Updated to 1.20.1\n- Added a small log message when config is being loaded","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-23T21:37:33.528166Z","downloads":3811,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"4e6a6cced4bc51f03703b63e11d51335fccd48cce0093cc8fa420f4b9a39e18fa1798a40fd1638e2d9e478515966c58dbd08abb9b79a29353e3c02d18d165da3","sha1":"c9f5bae420984a5c8a8b0b11527ac27cc0d76d52"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/eEpWUjwq/versions/cBbVgZbj/farsighted-mobs-forge-1.1-1.20.1.jar","filename":"farsighted-mobs-forge-1.1-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":12335,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HuHwXEsl","user":{"id":"nzHM76iA","username":"sindarin27","name":"Gwyddion Sindarin","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55894434?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-01-16T14:26:52.202166Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"farsighted-mobs-forge-1.1-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\YungsBetterEndIsland-1.20-Forge-2.0.5.jar":{"sha512":"2f3cf7806e3c60fe232d78edff53df03f9a4b1c80936996d3e9778cbcb0231b2e7ddf206832ed47fe7684cfe334c6a77cea824271d6053ed3d67325d82dd9a00","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2BwBOmBQ","slug":"yungs-better-end-island","project_type":"mod","team":"lt2MvEeI","title":"YUNG's Better End Island","description":"An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!","body":"<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CbEPuEE.png\" alt=\"YUNG's Better End Island\" width=\"1344\" height=\"416\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsapibadge\" alt=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" width=\"211\" height=\"26\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" href=\"https://discord.gg/rns3beq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsdiscordbadge2\" alt=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" width=\"136\" height=\"28\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungstwitterbadge3\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" width=\"104\" height=\"37\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsyoutubebadge\" alt=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Support me on Patreon!\" href=\"https://patreon.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungspatreonbadge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon!\" width=\"138\" height=\"28\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ePR2LMC.png\" alt=\"What is this?\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

Basically, almost every **hostile mob** has been reworked, from small changes to huge ones. Some of them are inspired by the Bedrock edition, which is a bit different *(and often harder)* than the Java one. There are now also a few **achievements** to make the experience even funnier!\n\nAlthough we've changed almost every mob already, feel free to ask for new features or changes in the [GitHub](https://github.com/sf-inc/sihywtcamd/issues) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/eNwkve8k7c).

Thank you @bstylia14 !\n\n# FAQ\n\n- **Does it work on a server?** Yes, it works on a server. File needed for **both** client **and** server for full functionalities.

amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own

Gap Fix","description":"Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models","body":"Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":920393,"followers":1005,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"fbaUxdx3","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:46:18.529195Z","downloads":82862,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f11c4d7010f9572bd2e2ed64c15e544816226e0b","sha512":"a1ae3f750a323927508fcf9b6fe43deddefd6ac32687ade5d37283e93e178bdfa3629e719dbdedaf2717f317150f0f47f252ba75ab317663e89964ab7ed3d587"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/fbaUxdx3/modelfix-1.14.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14.jar","primary":true,"size":45182,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14.jar"},"mods\\wares-1.20.1-1.2.7.jar":{"sha512":"b841d3eaa0c3ef7ea0176be4b040362aadbb571df9c922077ee34c187e69c60094c56801fce97dde9178a9464823d61eb34509bd34964327271f42b0f3b742bc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Jz71ddli","slug":"wares","project_type":"mod","team":"R6eb9Bp2","title":"Wares","description":"Buy or sell hard earned goods by delivering packages.

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n# Compatibility\n\nQuark has built-in compatibility for a few mods, including JEI and TerraBlender.\n\nQuark may be incompatible with Optifine. If you are having issues using the two together, please uninstall Optifine and use a Sodium fork instead. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing load crashes on 1.20.1, make sure your other mods are up to date, as any mods with integration from older versions will not function until updated.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2024-03-02T17:21:10.052242Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":212334,"followers":425,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8","aKj03FLO","1d9CRYwK","sLfwgQ44","233kpcpB","a8AI08wJ","2u6IMNar"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"2u6IMNar","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-4.0-438","version_number":"1.20.1-4.0-438","changelog":"https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/releases/tag/release-1.20.1-4.0-438","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-02T17:21:11.652821Z","downloads":4570,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6e5572cc72b6b061e4edde8d9d8d2a7b868b1e82","sha512":"0f0189225bff9f6a7bb6365ce64a2643cc8d5bbb8ab0105938154d20d39411e88c1020481485f37ac24a6e7a6baa79bff77d71d053db430462ed1274fd8e2cdc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/2u6IMNar/Quark-4.0-438.jar","filename":"Quark-4.0-438.jar","primary":true,"size":14685489,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MVARlG2f","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"nxIuTMRv","username":"GoesBySully","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/nxIuTMRv/f4400aa9bc0120732ae57903fab324e986e726f7.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T12:53:22.188525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"2pSgrUlO","username":"IThundxr","name":"IThundxr","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74031881?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-14T19:41:15.163217Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"W53r0fU4","username":"Siuolplex","name":"Siuol","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43890828?v=4","bio":"","created":"2020-11-21T03:51:29.493313Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco Lavos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794735?v=4","bio":"holy hell","created":"2022-11-13T03:09:41.900759Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"IV1Ji8se","username":"quat","name":"quaternary","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2068021?v=4","bio":"Dragon","created":"2020-12-24T00:27:44.019284Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Quark-4.0-438.jar"},"mods\\Soothing Button-0.3.jar":{"sha512":"6e37ca69b73c0d12760cce1bcf16e5fe110c266b4467fa8627a24039f57242cebc0ca1dcd5440a3b19d2ead5b21e25f0fba876bf88c246836d3881adfff8a09f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"tYtnyqL1","slug":"soothing-button","project_type":"mod","team":"nC0jwtXq","title":"Soothing Button","description":"Adds a button to the title screen with the most soothing physics ever!

Now here's a source code you can easily use in your projects!\n\n### What's in the update:\n## A bit different button physics\n- Physics may be a bit different from the previous versions, because I've changed the delta time variable from Minecraft's one to mine using System.currentTimeMillis();\n\n## Mario mode was added!\n- This mode changes the button to a little Mario, that says funny stuff sometimes, also, he has it's own cute sounds when he hits the edges\n- Also, when you turn on Mario mode, you can notice that he has shadows! But they're a bit more complex you can think, when they're rotating with mario, the \"shadow\" illusion is brokes, so... I've added dynamic offset for shadows, so you can see that the shadow is pointing always down :)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-01-30 132447](https://github.com/SonicallGameXGit/Soothing-Button/assets/116002303/7ea040ef-94f1-4fe8-b47d-7084a175d4de)\n\n## Now button can rotate!\n- Don't worry, physics isn't changed at all! They're really simple and _super fast_ as before! I've just added visual rotation and smooth snap to nearest of these angles: 0, 90, 180, 270 and 360 when the button is on ground!\n\n![image](https://github.com/SonicallGameXGit/Soothing-Button/assets/116002303/d9d2bf34-a1b2-42a9-ba61-ccae7e1dfe37)\n![Screenshot 2024-01-30 132716](https://github.com/SonicallGameXGit/Soothing-Button/assets/116002303/e497f061-830c-45ff-97a8-820a4dd3c4f7)\n\n## Config was added!\n- Now you can change config and control parameters like \"Mario Mode\", \"Screen Shake\", \"Rotate Speed\", \"Rotate Sharpness\" and \"Score Flash Speed\" easily, also, after config was added, your score is saving after you quit the game and when you'll open it again, all score will return to you!

This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2024-02-28T19:40:53.632594Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":186923,"followers":86,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x","Xdw9cSFG","rmDI9Owy","H2MVcwUf","3OJWvUG9","ssXkoBKk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"ssXkoBKk","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 2.5.4","version_number":"2.5.4","changelog":"-Fixed slow chunk load times caused by SurfaceRules\n\n-Added example rainbow shader","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-28T19:40:54.447673Z","downloads":19808,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e7f209ae09cf818ecf98698482b82a1cbe0fe058","sha512":"98f3610b2ee6782211369b7beedb57392d41db3bf0f0ce143fe349ab783766429bb3049f0dbe5ee7998430f19d53e674348caf0cafd6c84a7d379ec6cea17ad4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/ssXkoBKk/citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar","filename":"citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3181461,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-2.5.4-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\another_furniture-forge-1.20.1-3.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"2a94115244184390d54804a921a1780b43fa0dcbc76fa1c1927d691b734ba3830a82cbb121d53131bc5df7dacdf6dc79d968d3282ff493e4058a697d91f38086","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ulloLmqG","slug":"another-furniture","project_type":"mod","team":"c08vO3pp","title":"Another Furniture","description":"Vanilla-styled Minecraft furniture mod.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QiboDom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1127\" height=\"634\" /></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong><b><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fdiscord.com%252finvite%252f3sEFCSkUcV\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/878598895788240936?label=&amp;color=cd904d&amp;labelColor=5f331a&amp;logo=Discord&amp;logoColor=ffffff&amp;style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"Discord\" width=\"137\" height=\"28\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/starfishstudios\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/starfishstudios?label=&amp;color=cd904d&amp;labelColor=5f331a&amp;logo=Twitter&amp;logoColor=ffffff&amp;style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"Twitter\" width=\"86\" height=\"28\" /></a></b></strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><b>Decorating your home just got better!</b><strong><b> Another Furniture </b></strong>adds various furniture, with the goal of staying vanilla-styled and consistently sized, keeping normal blocks and player sizes in mind.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>📝 Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Can I use this mod in my modpack or make videos about it?<br /></strong>A: Yes!

The restore defaults button allows for resetting a single config file as a whole (you can tell a config has been modified when it's name is in italics). There is also a button for opening the actual config file in an editor. The copy to defaults button allows you to set this config as a default config to be used whenever the config is recreated (mainly useful for server configs when creating new worlds).</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/956/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">When a config is open, you'll find a big list with all config options and categories. The button to the right of every option will restore it's default value. When an option is hovered, a tooltip will provide additional information, including the internal key, description, range, allowed values, and the default value. On the bottom, the cancel button can be used for discarding changes, the done button will save all changes to the config file.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/950/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The path bar on top shows where you currently are within the active config file. But there's more: It also functions as a navigation bar. You can click on previous categories to go back to them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/951/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Searching is quite fancy, the current query is highlighted, and found entries are sorted accordingly. Results will be located in the current, as well as all subsequent categories. And best of all, the search field can be cleared again with a simple left-click.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/952/2021-10-05_16.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing more complex values such as strings, enums and lists is done via a separate screen. In this case, an enum value can be chosen from a list where all choices can be viewed at a glance.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/953/2021-10-05_17.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing lists on the other hand looks quite a bit different. All values are entered as strings and will be converted and checked automatically. Sometimes, the type of a list cannot be determined by Config Menus for Forge, so you'll be promted to choose the type yourself, or edit the option directly in the config file instead (not yet implemented). Also lists cannot be saved when invalid entries have been added, they need to be manually corrected before that.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/407/181/2021-11-09_23.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing server configs is a bit different from other config types. They exist for every single world, so to edit a server config from the main menu you'll have to select a world. When you're currently playing in a world this world will be selected automatically. This message is shown when Config Menus for Forge has to create the server config first as it doesn't exist yet.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/407/182/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This message is shown when playing on an online server. Server configs can only be edited by server operators. When doing so, they'll be synced back to the server and from there to all other clients. In singleplayer no warnings are shown and no syncing happens as everything is done locally.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Can I edit server configs with this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> YES!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Can I edit server configs while on a multiplayer server?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes again! The only limitations are that you need to be an operator on that server, and Config Menus for Forge needs to be installed server-side as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can't edit Forge's client config!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> You have OptiFine installed, Forge's client config can't be used then. This has nothing to do with Config Menus for Forge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a server owner and I don't want anyone to edit the server's configs while it is running.</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Simply don't install Config Menus for Forge on your server, everything but editing server configs will still work for your players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a mod developer and I already added custom backgrounds for Configured. Do I need to do it for this mod again?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No, Config Menus for Forge uses the resources provided by mods for Configured as well. There are other developer options planned for the future though. In case you're unsure about adding a custom background to the config menus for your mod, check out the instructions on the mod page for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a developer and I want my mod to use these config menus. What do I need to do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Nothing really. Just ask your users to install this mod alongside yours. You don't need to add a dependency or anything like that.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆

Free Levels","description":"Flattens the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs and makes renaming items always cost 1 level","body":"Reaching high levels in Minecraft is hard, because each level requires more XP than the last.  \n<br>\nSince Anvils and Enchantment Tables work off of levels, not off of collected XP, that means the higher your level, the higher the actual cost in terms of XP.  \n<br>\nTax Free Levels \"flattens the curve\" of the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs above level 30, meaning you'll always pay the same amount of XP, regardless of how high your level is.   \nIt also makes it so that renaming an item always only costs 1 level.  \n<br>\nMore precisely:  \nIf you are above level 30, instead of e.g. paying 3 levels, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from level 27 to 30.  \nIf the level cost is above 30, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from 0 to that level.\n\n* for Fabric Minecraft 1.16-1.20\n* required on the server and client\n* (it *does* work server-only, but the level cost won't show up correctly when renaming items)\n* compatible with Draylar1's [Reroll](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reroll)\n* compatible with

No code was taken, only the idea.","published":"2021-04-11T09:38:08.008060Z","updated":"2024-02-03T19:43:20.643804Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":104382,"followers":358,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["kyjJQ6is","NQmkmN36","2maMKx5T","6jbcl9c6","EGIMsnwc","fjgH8VUW","TuxALvSu","HnEdtPAA","OuxiHpnF","BPNCpouX","d4aBYiqJ","MZ3KFvJD","xRFlf1Co","Yzz234vY","KIjmjizn","LjDUjZCq","yEyvB3UM","6RvulguJ","wQCx7LxJ","bMwjs3jk","Snmnhtv7","O5rb19U4","HVJFHnm0","hTA88KZf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Snmnhtv7","project_id":"jCBrrLTs","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.3.9-forge","version_number":"1.3.9","changelog":"Enchanting Infuser compatibility for NeoForge and Forge and update for Fabric","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-24T11:19:09.403149Z","downloads":2825,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c241609ff00cbafadfa7215d04f1100f6cf7a003","sha512":"50e335d1262efafab670510c3eb1d8e568a536517695547a33af9c2a537262c8659419069a36c1aef6098ef5e44551a15b090cc4516750cc597ad3a8f7333cb2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/versions/Snmnhtv7/TaxFreeLevels-1.3.9-forge-1.20.2.jar","filename":"TaxFreeLevels-1.3.9-forge-1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":17495,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"izaW93I5","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TaxFreeLevels-1.3.9-forge-1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\polymorph-forge-0.49.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"b98103f539b000b1e4e866ff3276aeddfcb1e3198ebe8f0e5d88f24b96cb3f65a335016e8bc03bd41f78b3f6fc6a7f06973dff3bd3e7739f222ad56cde05b9d4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"tagwiZkJ","slug":"polymorph","project_type":"mod","team":"IyMJnv3l","title":"Polymorph","description":"No more recipe conflicts! Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n### Mod Integration\n\n**Note for 1.19.x: Many of these integrations have not been implemented yet on 1.19.x.**\n\n**Just Enough Items**\n\nUpon selecting a recipe to transfer from the Just Enough Item screen, the output will automatically change to match the\nselection if there is more than one possible output.\n\n**Modded Support**\n\nMany crafting tables that are simply variants of the vanilla crafting table will automatically be compatible. Other\ntypes of support may or may not be compatible; below is a list of all mods that Polymorph has specific integration with\nand has already been tested for functionality.\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)\n  - ME Crafting Terminal\n  - ME Pattern Terminal\n- [CraftingCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftingcraft)\n  - Portable Crafting\n  - Inventory Crafting\n- [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Cyclic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic)\n  - Crafter\n  - Workbench\n- [FastFurnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastfurnace)\n  - Furnace\n  - Blasting Furnace\n  - Smoker\n- [FastWorkbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)\n  - Crafting Table\n- [Iron Furnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces)\n  - All furnace variants\n- [Pretty Pipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n- [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage)\n  - Crafting Grid\n  - Pattern Grid\n- [Refined Storage Addons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage-addons)\n  - Wireless Crafting Grid\n- [Simple Storage Network](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-storage-network)\n  - Storage Request Table\n- [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks)\n  - Crafting Upgrade\n  - Smelting Upgrade\n- [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Tom's Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n\nPlease request support by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Polymorph/issues).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2023-12-05T07:44:23.596047Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":443094,"followers":332,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"km82tZAr","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-forge-0.49.2+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.2+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

out another player to whom they've given the second stone.\n\nRight-clicking the stone sends a particle trail in the direction of the player.\n\nGetting closer to the target player will also make them glow pink, allowing you to easily spot them. (Forge only) \n\nNow you can find friends without hitting F3 once!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRE5flchnYU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Heartstone works in three stages: 0-999 blocks, 1,000-9,999 blocks, and 10,000+ blocks.\n\nAs the distance between people increases, the particles indicating their direction will shrink and lower in pitch.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

[Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.","published":"2020-12-21T17:48:09.050177Z","updated":"2024-01-02T01:58:46.262754Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1672456,"followers":2643,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["tO4HJpLA","19624YsD","7AwqDL7J","Ff90AgU6","PGovBIXq","AXYWaIE8","kCiWZ1wv","QmrcLtH3","vJQ7plH2","UJ6FlFnK","vx0mZa04","Tncui9tU","jiDwS0W1","cQ60Ouax","X2k7QAQS","bRcuOnao"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"jiDwS0W1","project_id":"fQEb0iXm","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.2.3","version_number":"0.2.3","changelog":"* Updated to Minecraft 1.20\n* Removed a mixin that is now implemented in the base game\n* Improved protocol conformance - Krypton now handles servers dynamically disabling and re-enabling compression\n* Added events indicating when certain events in the network pipeline happen that mods can snoop on\n  * As a consequence of this, the old ViaFabric hooks have been removed.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T03:25:18.657621Z","downloads":841942,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4d499819effd8afe811e5d93952fcc46765a00df","sha512":"92b73a70737cfc1daebca211bd1525de7684b554be392714ee29cbd558f2a27a8bdda22accbe9176d6e531d74f9bf77798c28c3e8559c970f607422b6038bc9e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/versions/jiDwS0W1/krypton-0.2.3.jar","filename":"krypton-0.2.3.jar","primary":true,"size":185895,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LBcJZJkm","user":{"id":"y0WF9UR5","username":"astei","name":"Andrew Steinborn","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16436212?v=4","bio":"Sometime Minecraft modder, currently an software engineer at the fintech startup Ramp","created":"2020-12-21T14:36:31.896442Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"krypton-0.2.3.jar"},"mods\\YungsExtras-1.20-Forge-4.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"2c70e8e2c8e6161139bd19d302e225f7c12dc44f9cbdd63f4a548645fe923eb16de930abe2d2f8a89bee99f31d77798b7352bbd33f3642560cad18d86d372d4f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZYgyPyfq","slug":"yungs-extras","project_type":"mod","team":"DA5XhvGI","title":"YUNG's Extras","description":"Extra structures, features, and vanilla+ content suitable for any modpack!","body":"<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hvBicGR.png\" alt=\"YUNG's Extras\" width=\"1344\" height=\"416\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsapibadge\" alt=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" width=\"211\" height=\"26\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" href=\"https://discord.gg/rns3beq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsdiscordbadge2\" alt=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" width=\"136\" height=\"28\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungstwitterbadge3\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" width=\"104\" height=\"37\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsyoutubebadge\" alt=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Support me on Patreon!\" href=\"https://patreon.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungspatreonbadge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon!\" width=\"138\" height=\"28\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2HNgRET.png\" alt=\"What is this?\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\n A myriad of structures, features, and vanilla+ content.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

Modules\n\nConnector Extras is divided into several submodules for each type of integration.\n\n### Team Reborn Energy API Bridge\n\nA bridge between Forge Energy (FE) and Team Reborn's [Energy API](https://github.com/TechReborn/Energy) (E) that allows\ntwo-way conversion of energy units, for both BlockEntities and ItemStacks.\nThe default conversion ratio is `1 E : 10 FE`, and can be configured for both directions individually.\nSetting a ratio to `0` will disable conversion in its direction.\n\n### REI Plugin Platform Bridge\n\nRuns [REI](https://github.com/shedaniel/RoughlyEnoughItems)'s Fabric plugin detector on Forge in addition to the default\none, allowing it to load plugins from mods of both platforms at once.\nIncludes parts of REI Fabric code in the `me.shedaniel.rei` package, licensed under the\n[MIT License](https://github.com/shedaniel/RoughlyEnoughItems/blob/8c03832d5ae716beba4047166505181cadd76e75/LICENSE).\n\n### EMI Plugin Platform Bridge\n\nSimilar to the REI Bridge, it loads [EMI](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi) plugins of Fabric mods on Forge.\nIncludes parts of EMI API code in the `dev.emi.emi.api` package, licensed under the\n[MIT License](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi/blob/deef228b4a35cbcccd2e48e645118ed333a26013/LICENSE).\n\n### Reach Entity Attributes - Forge\n\nA Forge port of the Fabric [Reach Entity Attributes](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/reach-entity-attributes)\nlibrary, implemented alongside Forge's own reach attributes. Allows for compatiblity with Fabric mods that require it,\nbut wouldn't otherwise be compatible due to the heavy forge mixin conflicts of the original version.\n\n### Architectury API Bridge\n\nRegisters mod event buses of Fabric mods to [Architectury](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) Forge to avoid registry init issues.\n\n### Terrablender Bridge\n\nRuns the `terrablender` of Fabric mods on Forge, making their usage with the Forge version\nof [TerraBlender](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/TerraBlender) possible.  \n\n### Geckolib\n\nGeckolib Forge is incompatible with most Fabric mods that use Geckolib for Fabric. In these cases, Geckolib Fabric must\nbe used instead. Connector Extras fixes a few issues that have arised with this version:\n- To improve compatibility, we bridge Gekolib's `RenderProvider` to Forge, fixing an issue that turned\nsome items invisible.\n- Initialize `Minecraft#resourceManager` before Connector loads fabric mods, which is required to run Geckolib Fabric\n\n### ModMenu\n\nIntegrates ModMenu the config screen factory with Forge's mod list gui.\n\n### Continuity Compat\n\nFixes Continuity's connected textures for modded blocks. By default, Continuity builds a map of model IDs to all registered blocks in its client initializer (`ModelWrappingHandler#createBlockStateModelIdMap`). However, this is too soon as it happens before blocks of Forge mods are registered. As a results, CTM models will not be created for Forge mod blocks. To fix this issue, we patch Continuity to move the block state map initialization from Fabric's client entrypoint to FML's client setup event, which is fired after registration has completed.\n\n### Amecs API - Forge port\n\nA Forge port of the Fabric [Amecs API](https://github.com/Siphalor/amecs-api)\nlibrary, implemented alongside Forge's key modifier system. Allows for compatiblity with Fabric mods that require it,\nbut wouldn't otherwise be compatible due to the heavy forge mixin conflicts of the original version.\n\n### Forge Config API Port - Forge bridge\n\nA clean implementation of [Forge Config API Port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric)\non Forge, allowing Fabric mods to easily access the Forge config system and register their own configs.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble using Connector Extras or believe it is not functioning correctly, ask us\non [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Sinytra/ConnectorExtras/discussions), our discord, or open an issue in this\nrepository.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n\n1.

These essentially correspond to the vanilla regular and jigsaw structure types, but with better placement and a clearer json format.\nBoth types can choose from the following placements:\n| Identifier | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| `surface` | Will place the structure at the top layer of solid blocks |\n| `ceiling` | Will place the at the bottom layer of solid blocks |\n| `on_water` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are water |\n| `on_lava` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are lava |\n| `underground` | Will place the structure somewhere between the top and bottom layers of blocks |\n| `underground_surface` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the bottom of an open area |\n| `underground_ceiling` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the top of an open area |\n| `underground_buried` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, such that it is not exposed to any open area |\n| `underground_on_lava` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, in an open area on top of lava |\n\n### Structure Pool Element Types\nFormations adds one new structure pool element type, `formations:single_pool_element`. The element type allows setting a different ground level rather than vanilla's fixed ground level of 0. The ground level can be set through the `ground_level` key.\n\n### Structure Processors\nFormations adds a bunch of new structure processors.\n| Identifier | Parameters | Description |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `formations:random_bed_color` | - | Randomizes the color of any beds |\n| `formations:biome_replacements` | - | Replaces certain blocks, such as wood, bricks and grass, based on the biome |\n| `formations:fill_brewing_stands` | `slotFillChance`, `maxBlazePowder` | Fills brewing stands with random potions and blaze powder ` |\n| `formations:fill_chiseled_bookshelves` | `slotFillChance` | Fills chiseled bookshelves with enchanted books |\n| `formations:block_age` | `mossiness`, `degradation`, `disintegration` | Randomly replaces regular blocks with mossy or cracked variants, full blocks with slabs or stairs, random blocks with air |\n| `formations:random_plant_growth` | `minGrowth`, `maxGrowth` | Randomizes the growth stage of any crops |\n| `formations:respawn_anchor_charges` | `minCharges`, `maxCharges` | Randomizes the number of charges of any respawn anchors |\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Examples\nFor examples usage of the features, you can check out [<img width='25' alt='formations overworld logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KX1XC0Oo/623ec34d4dbc1ca9c5aa6477f9043e86bbaa899b.webp'> Formations Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-overworld) and [<img width='25' alt='formations nether logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cGvQGRls/2e21f4c247ad58965c320f037c4febfa9cf827bb.webp'> \n Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)\n\n## Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

It also gives server owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.\n\nThe mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side. The mod already integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) mods. Make sure to update them to the latest versions.\n\nThe API of the mod allows the implementation of player permission systems to be used by the mod for some permission nodes (e.g. for having rank-based claim limits), with Prometheus, FTB Ranks, LuckPerms and the Forge/Fabric permission APIs having built-in support. It also allows the implementation of party systems to be used by claims alongside or instead of the default party system, with Argonauts and FTB Teams having built-in support. The default party system or claims can be disabled completely in the main config file.\n\n## Commands:\n/openpac ... - player config commands\n\n/openpac-claims ... - everything claim-related\n\n/openpac-parties ... - everything party-related\n\n/opm - shortcut for the party chat\n\n## Key Bindings:\n' - open the mod UI. Can be changed in the controls menu.\n\n## Configs:\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - the main mod config. Make sure to shut down the server before editing it, or the server might overwrite all your changes.\n\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-... - some global \"player configs\", although all of them can be accessed in game through the UI\n\n## FAQ\n### 1) How do I configure the mod on my server?\nThe mod is mainly configured through the main config file at _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, or sometimes _[server directory]/config/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_ on Fabric/Quilt, while the server isn't running. Server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, can be edited by OPs in-game with the UI (check your key bindings). Normal players can configure their own player config with the same UI. If the mod isn't installed on the client side, then you can use the player config chat commands instead.\n\n### 2) How do I use this mod as a regular player?\nMost things related to claims can be accessed with the in-game UI (check your key bindings). If you have the Xaero's World Map mod installed, you can view and edit your claims on the map screen as well, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection. You can also use chat commands to make/edit claims. Parties can only be created and managed through chat commands at the moment.\n\n### 3) Why are some options greyed out in my player config?\nThe server admin/owner can configure with the main config file option _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_ which specific options players have access to. Everything else uses the value in the default player config.\n\n### 4) How do I disable all protection on my server?\nIn the server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, disable the main protection option. Next, edit the config file _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Remove the main option _claims.protectClaimedChunks_ from _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_.\n\n## Supported Mods:\nA lot of (usually smaller) mods should be supported by the claimed chunk protection automatically. Some mods go above and beyond with the mechanics they add to the game or modify, in which case chunk protection is not guaranteed and should be manually added, either to this mod or with an additional one. Feel free to leave suggestions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims/issues) for the mods that you'd like to be supported.

In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

banner](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/584f8802ba8b734cbdb35dd06d588f2f486b9d04.png)\n\n# A Better Food System for Modern Minecraft\n\n**Spice of Life: Valheim Edition completely overhaul's Minecraft's food meter to work like a proper survival game, taking after Valheim's food slot system, where food lasts for a set amount of time and provides you with health, regeneration, and other benefits.**\n\n_While not required, it is highly recommended to install a food addon like Farmer's Delight alongside this mod._\n\n​![SOL Valheim hotbar](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/2fb0b3be3479e0f2ba9d0b1a1fa9d7144f3ba3c7.png)\n\n# Why Use This Mod?\n​\nMinecraft's food system is inherently unbalanced. As more food items have been added, and become easy to obtain and farm, hunger has become just an annoyance. When your only goal is to keep the meter full enough to sprint (e.g. chugging a stack of bread), the problem can be solved 30 seconds after creating a new world by planting sweetberries or punching a few animals. The only benefit to better foods is eating less often (and regenerating more in combat), but you can get a steady supply of endgame foods in a few hours with farms.\n\nOther mods, like previous Spice of Life editions, attempt to fix this problem by giving the player rewards or punishments for not maintaining a diverse diet. This is layering an extra system on top of the food meter, which most players ignore and continue chugging bread, or find ways to game the system.\n\nIn Minecraft Alpha, there was no hunger bar, and you would eat food to heal hearts when you got low. Spice of Life: Valheim Edition essentially replicates this with a more modern take. Like in Valheim, you have three food slots which you must fill. Eating a food item will fill a slot, giving you the benefits of increased health and regeneration until it runs out. You then cannot eat that food again until the timer runs out (or almost runs out).\n\nYou will start with three hearts (configurable), and you must eat food to increase that, up to a maximum of an entire extra bar of hearts if you eat healthy modded foods from Farmer's Delight and similar mods. If you have a full stomach, you also get a slight speed boost (also configurable). You can see these stats when you hover over a food item, and when you eat it, it will appear above your hotbar with a timer.\n\n![SOL Valheim food info](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/2ff12cf2f30ef393576708473439e4bdf8fff645.png)\n\nThis is a pretty simple system, but ends up balancing many unrelated aspects of the game:\n- You must plan when to eat and what foods to eat instead of just chugging bread. \n- Survival is more difficult, since you don't start with full hearts, and must eat good food to build up your durability. \n- Combat is harder, since you won't regenerate hearts until you haven't taken damage in a few seconds (though you can still eat Golden Apples whenever you want). \n- Farming and cooking is more rewarding, since you can no longer get by with mediocre foods, and must craft good meals. \n- And, lastly, baking cake is actually useful for once--providing a good source of multiple meals that you can quickly eat after respawning.\n\nYou can also reset your currently eaten foods by vomiting, which you can trigger by eating rotten flesh:\n\n![rotten flesh vomiting](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/06b20fd18e1bbc36e20851d504c14c215ef23c95.png)\n\nEvery aspect of the mod is configurable, so you can adjust the strength of certain foods, regeneration, and timers.\n\n![configuration](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6d3ccadf7fc75944cb7b54870a3ab54f794957d7.png)\n\nThis does fundamentally change how Minecraft's food works by effectively disabling the food bar entirely, so some other mods may function unexpectedly as if the player is starving or full. Please report any breaking issues to the issue tracker or on Discord.\n\nThis is compatible with other mods that modify the hunger bar, like AppleSkin. But since rendering of the hunger bar is turned off, AppleSkin won't do anything.\n\n[Our Discord](https://discord.gg/kyBCuYUzFB)\n","published":"2024-01-16T01:15:40.904781Z","updated":"2024-01-27T17:37:14.369489Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":995,"followers":36,"categories":["adventure","food","game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":["equipment","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["raKPKFB7","Ugkgmunw","kcOOe5S6","roJIseD4","hcLKrXQm","t2L5ivoG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mKalCkNV/fa1d712fc0590a6b5ad100dca71cbe04562ddd74.png"},"version":{"id":"roJIseD4","project_id":"mKalCkNV","author_id":"dSn53j6E","featured":false,"name":"SOL: Valheim 1.1.1 Forge 1.20.1","version_number":"1.1.1-forge-mc1.20.1","changelog":"View changelog at https://github.com/anthxnymc/sol_valheim","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-27T17:36:03.473671Z","downloads":294,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"456d16a347557498cf0a543d717b4c680a9831c0","sha512":"c83b9c98c2233b18220cebce8ddba91792031a863a04812cdc3c67a0ed9c228b4483100fe5e20b852e36cc30737d2c7926c356489d1596187586d08b2cd617d1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mKalCkNV/versions/roJIseD4/sol_valheim-1.1.1-4.jar","filename":"sol_valheim-1.1.1-4.jar","primary":true,"size":43086,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"lhGA9TYQ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2t27nF5q","user":{"id":"dSn53j6E","username":"nthxny","name":"Anthony","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/dSn53j6E/4e7e7b1070e159552aa42e99e35055c1f2563097.jpeg","bio":"making software for block game","created":"2023-06-19T05:31:10.368204Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sol_valheim-1.1.1-4.jar"},"mods\\fabric-api-0.92.0+1.11.3+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"1042031096f1b0f2238ec3b56b8a55435fcc73feca68596a5787d69db46cd86b92cf2800b62f7ba4f27abbede8455256f5c51117261eeedc15a95e355f1d602e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Aqlf1Shp","slug":"forgified-fabric-api","project_type":"mod","team":"64oH05ys","title":"Forgified Fabric API","description":"Fabric API implemented on top of MinecraftForge","body":"# Forgified Fabric API\n\nEssential hooks for modding with Fabric ported to MinecraftForge.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for mods.

This display is also now used in the inventory, as it's way more compact and allows for many more effects to be shown before they start to overlap. And this new inventory display is no longer limited to the player inventory, now you can see your active effects in every container!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But wait, now that status effects are shown small and compact with just an icon, how will you find out how your active effects are called? Don't worry, a handy tooltip is added for that. The tooltip will be even more useful when <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Just Enough Effect Descriptions</strong></span></a> by <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mehvahdjukaar\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MehVahdJukaar</strong></span></a> is installed.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You like the vanilla inventory status effect display and want to keep it or even use it on the hud as well? No problem! You can choose any widget mode you want, or even none. Alongside that there are many configurable settings, such as the screen side for effects, amount of rows and columns, a custom alpha value, text colors, custom screen positions, and much, much more.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/askYVd2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/288/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/290/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Stylish effects in action being very stylish</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Various effect render types can be chosen and configured</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/291/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/292/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Compact effects replace the vanilla display inside of the inventory</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>The effects display is shown in every container, not just the inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/293/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/294/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Useful tooltips will appear when effect widgets are hovered</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many possible settings, create your very own effect display</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/295/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Great JEI and REI compatibility</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/askYVd2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Xaero's World Map mod adds a self-writing fullscreen map to your Minecraft client. Works as a separate mod but is a lot better with Xaero's Minimap. The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible. <strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n<p>The mod is still in development! Please report any bugs that you encounter or otherwise they probably won't get fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your world is optimized (<em>Singleplayer - Edit - Optimize World</em>) for the Minecraft version you're playing (repeat after every Minecraft update). It takes A LOT longer to generate singleplayer maps from unoptimized world saves.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">patreon.com/xaero96</span></a>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li>A self-writing world map (as opposed to manual paper maps). You can create multiple maps on the same server address and switch between them either manually or automatically.</li>\n<li>Works in Singleplayer, Multiplayer and on Realms.</li>\n<li>Intuitive interface. Open the map screen by&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">pressing M</strong>. Move the map around with your mouse and zoom in/out using the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mouse wheel</strong>, similar to Google Maps. All relevant controls are listed in a tooltip on the map screen and you can customize a lot of them.</li>\n<li>Optional automatic multiple world detection on servers.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.

Although in most cases the mod should perform great by default.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's Minimap</a>&nbsp;integration. The minimap mod will display chunks provided by the world map. The world map mod will display waypoints from the Xaero's Minimap mod.

The following potion effects exist as of writing this:&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">xaeroworldmap:no_world_map.&nbsp;</em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">xaeroworldmap:no_world_map_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Since version 1.14.0</strong>&nbsp;of the mod, you can open an on-map waypoint menu by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner of the map screen. In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!</li>\n<li>Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add&nbsp;<em>mapItemId:minecraft:compass&nbsp;</em>anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\">Get Xaero's Minimap</span></a></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?\n\n<p>First, exit the server and locate the Minecraft game directory that you're using to play on the server. In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Expect all kinds of critters from small to big now roaming your Minecraft world\n \n## Mod-loader, Version and Config\n\nThis mod is being developed for Fabric and Forge. No backports are planned.\n\nTo modify which animals you can find in your world you can just use a data-pack to edit the respective biome tags that they use to spawn.\n\n# Content\n\n![tab](https://imgur.com/kDd5Q7r.png)\n\n### To take a closer look at the features, go to the images section or even look at the wiki!\n**Currently the wiki is wip, but will be updated soon**\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Angler Fish** : \n\nAngler fish spawn in all Deep Oceans, they have unique pathfinding and will always prefer staying near the bottom of bodies of water, making them often found near the ocean depths.\n\n-Angler fish have an emissive layer and custom particles\n\n-Angler fish can be bucketed\n\n-Angler fish cannot withstand the pressure of being on land and will promptly deflate when exposed to air\n\n-When an Angler fish is fed shiny items it will grant the player with `5 minutes of night vision` (these items are contained in a special tag, so they can be edited easily in mod-packs\n\n-Angler fish drop themselves as an item and can be eaten for `5 seconds of night vision`\n\n\n- **Tuna** : \n\nTunas can be found swimming around in Cold Oceans and regular Oceans, both deep and normal. They are the first farmable fish and come with food items and new breeding mechanics.\n\n-Tunas can be bred with fish from a custom tag, once bred they will lay a `Tuna Egg`, a new Armor Stand like entity that will hatch into a baby Tuna\n\n-Tunas are too big to be bucketed, but don't worry, you can transport Tuna Eggs easily with a bucket\n\n-Tunas drop multiple `Tuna Chunks` when killed, which can be cooked, eaten, or turned into a `Tuna Sandwich`\n\n\n- **Seahorse** : \n\nSeahorses are found in Warm Oceans and are the only fish capable of turning its head to look at you!\n\n-Seahorses come in `6 different variants` and when bucketed they display their color with a handy tooltip\n\n-Seahorses are actually capable of clicking and growling, just like in real life\n\n\n- **Snail** : \n\nSnails can be found in Taigas and Old Growth Pine/Spruce Taigas and are quite packed with features\n\n-Snails retreat in their shell when taking damage or when a non shifting player is nearby. When in their shell they are immune to melee damage lower than 12 and cannot move\n\n-You can remove a `Snail's Shell` by shooting a projectile at the Snail while it's not inside its home, the shell can regrow with time\n\n-Snail Shells have 4 main uses: they can be used to turn into bone meal, they can be used to craft `Potted Sweet Berries`, a new block that allows you to collect berries with style while also keeping you safe from their thorns, it can be used in conjunction with other ingredients to create `Escargot` and it can be used as a building material to make some fancy new blocks!\n\n-When Snails get wet, they produce a `Mucus` Trail. This can be triggered by making them stand on wet sponges, mud or getting in contact with water (these blocks can be configured), right clicking them with a bucket of water or exposing them to rain\n\n-Mucus slows down all mobs that aren't Snails and it can be collected to then be either cooked into slime or turned into `Mucus Blocks` a handy new redstone block\n\n-Mucus Blocks slow down entities on contact and solidify when next to water, making players able to walk on them. The solidification of mucus spreads through Mucus Blocks in a circular manner\n\n-With Phantom Membrane Mucus Blocks can be turned into `Ghostly Mucus Blocks`, which work the same way, but when not solidified can be walked through just fine and do not slow the player down\n\n-When Snails are bred they both will lay a clutch of eggs to mimic how Snails are hermaphroditic in real life\n\n\n- **Hamster** : \n\nHamsters can be found in Plains and Meadows and more commonly is Sunflower Fields. The Minecraft Sunflower has been replaced with a new one that now rotates with the sun and can be farmed for `Sunflower Seeds`.\n\n-Sunflower Seeds can be roasted to then be eaten fast like dried kelp\n\n-Hamsters spawn with `4 different variants` and randomly look out for danger by standing on their back feet\n\n-Hamsters can be tamed with Sunflower Seeds, once tamed they can be told to sit and follow like other pets\n\n-Hamsters are very territorial and Hamsters tamed to the same player will try to kill each other\n\n-Hamsters actively collect items and put them in their cheek pouches, once their inventory is full their cheeks will get visually larger\n\n-Players can open their Tamed Hamsters' cheek pouch up and use it as portable storage\n\n\n- **Ant** : \n\nAnts are by far the biggest addition, they spawn in Savannas, Plains and biomes in the `#forest` tag packed inside tiny `Anthill` structures \n\n-Ants have a whole biome dedicated to them called `Ant Gardens`, this biome is full of `Fallen Leaves`, Coarse Dirt, Anthills and `Rotten Trees`\n\n-Ants spawn with randomized Speed, Health and Attack and are neutral, they all attack you if you anger one\n\n-Ants work like Bees and can set their home in Anthills. They also collect resources from Dead Bushes and Tall Grass (configurable with a tag) and bring them back to their home.\n\n-Anthills that have the resource level of 3 randomly turn blocks in a 3x3 radius below them into rotten versions of themselves, consuming all 3 of the resource levels. Logs become `Rotten Logs` and Dirt like blocks become `Ant Mounds`. Anthills come in 3 variants: Anthills, Rotten Log Anthills and Ant Farms. \n\n-Rotten Logs have a new unique woodset not strong enough to craft signs and build boats, but able to be mined faster, you can also obtain a new block by clicking `Rotten Planks` with an axe, `Cracked Rotten Planks`, which produce scary creaky noises when walked on\n\n-Ant Mounds are a new brushable block, when destroyed they anger nearby ants and don’t drop their loot, so make sure to brush it instead! They can be found in `Ant Mounts`, or they can be made by an Anthill, having different loot tables\n\n-Fallen Leaves can be found in Ant Mounds and Ant Gardens and are a new decorative block for your fall themed builds\n\n-`Ant Pupae` can also be found rarely in Ant Mounds, when clicked on the ground they spawn baby `Tamed Ants`\n\n-Tamed Ants work like dogs, they attack any mob you attack and their abdomen can be colored with dyes! Adult Tamed Ants will target other adult Tamed Ants with a different colored abdomen, effectively making you able to set up ant wars\n\n-`Ant Farms` can be crafted with Ant Pupae and are the Beehive alternative to regular Anthills, because they can be collected without silk touch and can be renewably made\n\n-Ant Mounts are a new dungeon structure found in Ant Gardens. They have 4 possible variations and are FULL of Ants and Ant Mounds. The gameplay of the structure consists brushing Ant Mounds and Digging the Packed Mud to get to the other chambers, just be sure not to hit an Ant or break an Ant Mound/Anthill because Ants fight back! This structure has 4 main unique items to find: Ant Pupa, `Crown Pottery Sherd`, `Spade Pottery Sherd` and the `Rot Music Disc`","published":"2023-11-09T23:30:39.563334Z","updated":"2023-11-12T12:05:23.309799Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":67976,"followers":157,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["decoration","food"],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["jGfbbkRl","73LBjQKv","1U2VhIFo","s7b61YnA","RXKJiHaV","Cjjsdx4e"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rex9wwpz/be0be8f4fe41eb5b0aaa2c2885291f36a70aeb9e.png"},"version":{"id":"RXKJiHaV","project_id":"rex9wwpz","author_id":"SRKJvluF","featured":false,"name":"Spawn

do.\n\nI've created a video explaining how to customize Scriptor in-depth.\nCheck it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLaZzCKMcQA).\n\nWelcome to Scriptor, the mod which gives words power.\nThis Vanilla-style mod adds various kinds of magic spell to the world\nwith the aim of making discovery and spellcrafting simple, interesting,\nand reasonable when compared to Vanilla gear and capabilities.\n\nIn this mod, spells are constructed much like sentences, with a catch:\n\n**The words and sentence structure used are random in every world!**\n\nFor the average player, plenty of spells can be obtained in each world,\nbut for anyone dedicated enough, you can reverse engineer these spells\nand learn how to draft even more powerful spells yourself.\n\nFor information on usage and such, check out the docs on \n[GitHub](https://github.com/ssblur/scriptor/blob/main/doc/README.md)\nor explore the world in game to learn more about how magic works for\nyou.\n\n## Special

mod that adds random vanilla friendly features","body":"![logo](https://i.imgur.com/EsmxxXP.png \"Logo\")\n\n\n# About Etcetera\n\nEtcetera is a miscellaneous mod. This means that its features can range from blocks, to items, blocks, storage... et cetera. All these additions are made while keeping Minecraft's gameplay in mind and hopefully fit the game seamlessly.\n\n \n## Mod-loader and Version\n\nThis mod is being developed for Fabric and Forge. No backports are planned.\n\n# Content\n\n![tab](https://i.imgur.com/b2R2Ddr.png)\n\n### To take a closer look at the features, go to the images section or even look at the wiki!\n**Currently both the image section and the wiki is wip, but will be updated soon**\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Bismuth** : \nBismuth is a new ore found in the nether, when mined it gives experience like quartz, but its main focus is decoration and utilities. Bismuth blocks change color slowly over time and Bismuth Ingots can apply this kind of iridescence onto other vanilla blocks. Bismuth is also used to craft a **Chisel**, that can turn blocks into their chiseled form or remove iridescence, a  **Hammer** that can either be used for combat or to crack blocks (both the se items use a .json file format for their \"recipes\" for mod compat) and a  **Wrench**, a survival friendly debug stick that can modify blockstates in a limited fashion\n\n- **Handbell** : The Handbell is new item that is obtained from villagers and can call your pets or following allays to you when ringed if they are not sitting, and give them the glowing effect\n\n- **Drum** : A new noteblock like block that changes sound based on the block below and where the player hits the its top\n\n- **Dice** : A simple and compact redstone randomizer\n\n- **Frame** : A new block that assists builders into making, well, frameworks. It can be placed and replaced later without needing to be broken\n\n- **Prickly Can** : A storage block made with cactus that can delete all the items inside with a click\n\n- **Bouquet** : New items crafted with small flowers, it can only be placed in pots and on vases\n\n- **Vase** : A new block made with rooted dirt, it removes the offset of every block placed on top of it to make for great decoration\n\n- **Item Stand & Glowing Item Stand** :  Like an Item Frame, but in the middle of a block. You can click it with Glass to cover the item for bonus aesthetic points\n\n- **Squid Lamp** : A lamp made with Glow Ink Sacks, can be placed like a torch, glows much brighter underwater\n\n- **Tidal Helmet** :  New armor piece crafted with a Turtle Helmet and a Heart Of the Sea, its a much stronger version of the Turtle Helmet that gives Conduit Power, but also grants more Durability and Strength. This also comes with a new ui element that indicates how much conduit power you have left\n\n- **Turtle Raft** : New boat type entity, it can only old one passenger, but can be dyed like leather armor and can be adorned with banners. Its resistant to water bubble columns and can also fit through one block gaps\n\n- **Crumbling Stone** : A new type of stone that crumbles. When standing, jumping or hitting it with a projectile it starts breaking until you're left with no stone... It can be waxed to use as a decoration though!\n\n- **Leveled Stone** : Used to make Crumbling Stone, mainly used for decoration with it\n\n- **Light Bulb & Tinted Light Bulb** : A new light source that can be right-clicked to change the light value. Tinted Light Bulbs randomly flicker \n\n- **Chapples & Golden Chapples** : Chapples are a new Mooshroom-like Chicken mob, they can be spawned from a Eggple (found in Plains Villages and Pillager Outposts) and they lay Apples instead of Eggs. When a Chapple is struck by lightning or when it's spawned from a Golden Eggple (found in Bastions) it becomes a Golden Chapple, which has only a chance to lay Golden Apples instead of regular Apples\n\n- **Cotton** : Cotton is a new Crop, its seeds are traded by Villagers and found in Plains Villages, it gives Cotton when fully grown, which can be turned into Cotton Clothes, String or Wool\n\n- **Cotton Clothes** : New armor like items that come in 16 colors + Wandering Trader exclusive variant, sometimes have custom models and are slimmer than armor to fit your skin better. They cannot be enchanted and give no armor points, but also have no durability\n\n- **New Tags** :  \n`villager_can_pickup` -> items that can be picked up by Villagers\n`hammerable` & `chisellable` -> Blocks that can be Hammered or Chiseled (these Blocks will play a sound when right-clicked with the respective tool. This does not affect the recipe types of hammers and chisels, but only if they make a sound or not. For example the Anvil is in the Hammerable tag even if it can't be crushed via hamer, but this allows players to be able to hit it making hammering noises for roleplay purposes)\n`non_modifiable` -> Blocks that cannot be modified by a Wrench\n`offset_remover` -> Blocks that remove the XY offset of other Blocks placed on top of them\n`concrete`, `glazed_terracotta`, `sweaters`, `hats` -> item tags that contain all colored versions of their specific item\n`all_concrete`, `all_terracotta`, `all_glazed_terracotta`, `all_wool`, `all_glass_blocks`, `all_glass_panes` -> item tags that contain all colored versions of their specific item + their Bismuth Iridescent variant","published":"2023-07-20T00:05:47.802587Z","updated":"2023-07-24T05:35:02.620755Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":11555,"followers":76,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","management","mobs","storage","technology","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["hBIXWMPO","trBVKD10","OPoTKsQN","Hyth1pEu","OXt4Jd9P","hjOmY3MQ","Nc3JT04L","mUpQm7Ji","42Dm5geR","jLmh1Q4M","uua8xPy8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TaRVOwJr/8525b1bed9e38bf7743c8b789e96f85ec3f0a876.gif"},"version":{"id":"uua8xPy8","project_id":"TaRVOwJr","author_id":"SRKJvluF","featured":false,"name":"Etcetera 1.1.3-forge","version_number":"1.1.3","changelog":"+ Fixed dice block comparator redstone output","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-24T05:35:05.031508Z","downloads":2278,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e622d35948040ed59913cf21b19f109d8a29ec96","sha512":"12441dcc48f487a5f428dc1799548f46e391bd316358dfab1628ea2020061ee51676dc0f5ebe672980534505734e0cf1a817febf18ed73226b6096b15fb22265"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TaRVOwJr/versions/uua8xPy8/Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar","filename":"Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":1720394,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GVZU4hSZ","user":{"id":"pcavjK69","username":"Ninni","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64173061?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-03T14:55:31.295258Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"GVZU4hSZ","user":{"id":"SRKJvluF","username":"Orcinus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/SRKJvluF/6bc2c0d9ba49c8fc01ca93000e8b0696480a55e3.png","bio":"","created":"2021-12-04T03:54:57.699849Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor - Code","ordering":0},{"team_id":"GVZU4hSZ","user":{"id":"Yq8ublDx","username":"bunten","name":"bunten","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Yq8ublDx/d805b85b430281bf8c7aa12a2ded004018b6f519.png","bio":"iam developing\r\n","created":"2020-12-01T23:05:47.969541Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor - Sound Design","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar"},"mods\\gardens-of-the-dead-forge-4.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"40b50afd60a6a9a447499f1cd87a60407e6e2bf8eccd229df76331076ae4fb6bc1a9ab388b5eb59f83ae32a76429c611d20460504461ea702a5ab68d8b5423e8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lg1TPRFm","slug":"gardens-of-the-dead","project_type":"mod","team":"JgXmnLdP","title":"Gardens of the Dead","description":"Adds new spooky biomes to the Nether","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/gardens-of-the-dead/HEAD/forge/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n*This mod uses [TerraBlender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender) and [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api)*\n\nGardens of the dead is a mod that adds new spooky biomes to the Nether, created for [Spooky Jam 2022](https://spooky-jam.com/). \nAlong with the new biomes, Gardens of the Dead also adds new plants and decorative blocks.\nCurrently, 2 biomes are added, the Soulblight Forest and the Whistling Woods, pictured below.

Designed for better user experience and API.\n\nJade can be installed only on the client side. But many features require Jade on the server side. (item storage, horse stats, bees in beehive...)\n\n**For mod integration, try Jade Addons: [Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-forge)  [Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-fabric)**\n\n### Keys (default):\n\n - Keypad 0: Open configuration screen\n - Keypad 1: Toggle overlay\n - Keypad 2: Toggle liquid display\n - Keypad 3:

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents. Very useful!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/577/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/578/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Right-click a shulker box item to extract contents stack by stack</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Hold shift to see contents of a shulker box in your inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Pumpkins and Melons</strong> can be forced to appear from a fully grown stem, although this usally takes a few tries</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:

Blocks</strong> can be farmed by growing coral plants into coral reef structures, but this only works inside of a warm ocean biome, and corals are also very picky where to grow, so make sure no sea pickles and sea grass are anywhere above the coral plant</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Grass Blocks or Mycelium</strong> will be forced to spread when using bone meal on a dirt/coarsed dirt/dirt path block, when a grass block/mycelium is directly next to it, just like spreading nylium onto netherrack</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sweet Berry

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

use. It can be used for patching biomes, loot tables, models, and most other json files in the game. Whenever Mojang makes entity models data-driven, Patched will likely be able to patch those too, allowing for a basic alternative to OptiFine's CEM.\n\nHere's a list of a few different things one can achieve using Patched:\n* Removing or adding world gen features to biomes\n* Removing or adding criteria to advancements\n* Removing or adding loot to loot tables\n* Modifying recipes\n* And much more!\n\nPatched is intended to reduce conflicts between data/resource packs as well as between other mods.\nIt's also intended to ease the maintenance of these files, as you don't have to worry about other parts of the file becoming out of date (such as Minecraft updates that modify a biome you're changing an unrelated part of).\n\nPatched also comes with a few commands to inspect the state of the game (`/patchedc` for client-side):\n* `/patched list packs` shows a list of packs that have patches\n* `/patched list patches <pack>` shows a list of patches provided by a given pack\n* `/patched dump patch <pack> <name>` shows the contents of the patch provided by a specified pack\n* `/patched dump file <name>` shows the contents of a file, with comments indicating changes made to the file and by who\n\n## How it works\n\nPatched allows creating these so-called \"patch\" files with the same name as the file being patched.\nThese patches follow the syntax of [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902), with extra features to make it better in a modding context. The patch syntax is documented [here](https://github.com/EnderTurret/Patched/blob/main/docs/patches/operations.md) and there is a guide to authoring patches [here](https://github.com/EnderTurret/Patched/blob/main/docs/patches/patching_guide.md).\nFor example, to remove gravel from plains biomes:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"op\": \"find\",\n  \"path\": \"/features/6\",\n  \"test\": {\n    \"path\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"minecraft:ore_gravel\"\n  },\n  \"then\": {\n    \"op\": \"remove\",\n    \"path\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis patch would then be placed in a data pack at the location `data/minecraft/worldgen/biome` with the name `plains.json.patch`.\n\nIn order to be as performant as possible, Patched only looks for patches in packs that say they have any (i.e., it's on an opt-in basis). This is to avoid looking in all 200 some mods in your modpack even though only one actually has patches in it. A pack can enable patching by having this in its `pack.mcmeta`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pack\": {\n    \"patched:has_patches\": true // Indicates to Patched that this pack would like to patch things.\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs another example, this patch adds a custom biome to the \"adventuring time\" advancement:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"/criteria/mydatapack:mybiome\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"player\": [\n          {\n            \"condition\": \"minecraft:entity_properties\",\n            \"entity\": \"this\",\n            \"predicate\": {\n              \"location\": {\n                \"biome\": \"mydatapack:mybiome\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"trigger\": \"minecraft:location\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"/requirements/-\",\n    \"value\": [ \"mydatapack:mybiome\" ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nPatched hooks into the base resource loading code, allowing *any* json file to be patched -- even other patches (in theory). This will be compatible with the majority of mods, as they will have no need to modify this code, and any mod using Minecraft's resource loading (which is kind of a requirement) will gain the benefits of Patched. However, some mods may *also* change this resource loading code, which will cause at best lack of functionality and at worst crashes.\n\n## Limitations\n\nUnfortunately, there is one kind of json files that cannot be patched. Currently, that would be tags, which is because of how Minecraft loads them from each pack to merge them. Resources that are loaded in a similar style will also suffer from this problem.\n\nIn addition to this, on versions older than 1.19.3, vanilla biomes cannot be (directly) patched. This is because in these versions those biomes are hard-coded -- that is, there is no file to patch. This can be worked around by having a prior data pack add the biomes from say, the world gen export [here](https://github.com/slicedlime/examples), but I would just recommend updating to 1.19.3.","published":"2022-07-07T21:45:52.524915Z","updated":"2023-12-16T08:13:07.900009Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":11709,"followers":34,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["V4VIRCIv","OVmyaspg","qRgtNm1r","yxSD0y9A","6R7c24oE","DyeRYxuc","WdQ0mrLm","D5qfWpum","ToUX3iQg","wTCqw0UX","3OZVo6u1","2ddjccEL","Y8apkNRF","Z9cCaAMk","xwCR2C1I","U1BubPIq","BkRjPUfu","D8cvUlPE","HxzWpkRb","bM6hedCb","FToWwuxC","6VvR1NN2","gJMHOBep","7IQ14kuO","8sohL0iy","YtygM4i7","QYq4DxAH","gmzYmlDj","U1hQ2yH1","yJpQNKdx","7IdaL5qH","NfYYrzMk","k0k74uDM","roRbqfNl","4qWgB4SV","DemVFTVi","VUXoCJFz","kYqdyb6B","JloZyBDB","9cvpIYTF","uQpHu1ab","3a33c3nh","o8zsTrZf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IBlGrJtC/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VUXoCJFz","project_id":"IBlGrJtC","author_id":"H3pa46Xb","featured":false,"name":"forge-3.2.3+1.20.1","version_number":"3.2.3+1.20.1","changelog":"## Changes\n\n* Fix packs that take advantage of Minecraft's filtering causing Patched to throw countless errors.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T02:43:08.450112Z","downloads":823,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b6055801ed7694275971caaebba7802823aa48aea61e464187ce6e44888e50949ad6b5478aa11b6a30e6c10df91164f685cd7a364bf08af884acf734b632e336","sha1":"02b85991aa1184c44993bb456224b26bcc006e5d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IBlGrJtC/versions/VUXoCJFz/Patched-forge-3.2.3%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"Patched-forge-3.2.3+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":126166,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"9b663fcd4b114c117dcb7221284699eadb4ad0b7","sha512":"f1d3039d055b21394ea7c71a416b784cc7cd0ba50c9014eb2f67e4d7690f1258ca8b7595cd948acc9589dd6540315e7bc3f3cf0f922fb5ada4cd0377ff3dc2f0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IBlGrJtC/versions/VUXoCJFz/Patched-forge-3.2.3%2B1.20.1-sources.jar","filename":"Patched-forge-3.2.3+1.20.1-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":35458,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"lvIwlq4Y","user":{"id":"H3pa46Xb","username":"EnderTurret","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36442079?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T22:57:02.795651Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Patched-forge-3.2.3+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\notenoughanimations-forge-1.7.1-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"70a45be6285d23c4bd792ac1213da667ceab467d84373000c06cf3e8b66845942dfc83bb47ffa76974fad390dcefc74d5b09ece46158b3b0da97b68996b44171","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MPCX6s5C","slug":"not-enough-animations","project_type":"mod","team":"Eayl8ao3","title":"Not Enough Animations","description":"Bringing first-person animations to the third-person","body":"# Not Enough Animations \n\nThis mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person.

Good luck!","published":"2023-12-21T10:56:37.193174Z","updated":"2023-12-21T10:59:01.469541Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1730,"followers":15,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["Zi9XTUg0","M5c0LFrD","JEX2HfFr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/SvXrP8rT/2fdb79fcf873f3962a89943c8d7ac57ecc05a7cb.png"},"version":{"id":"Zi9XTUg0","project_id":"SvXrP8rT","author_id":"H8t5iidS","featured":false,"name":"Achievements Optimizer 1.0.2","version_number":"1.0.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-21T10:58:26.035433Z","downloads":1061,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"42263ee2a5ae94f8061b597e1f803a3aac8b527b","sha512":"49461bbd90c7eccad2b6635530787d27ed7d3b7d10576e67b83efe0771be25c87583e96dad6a7f43b10320fad608a02771e68afa96e540947408b94ef4509032"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/SvXrP8rT/versions/Zi9XTUg0/AchievementOptimizer-1.20.1-1.0.2.jar","filename":"AchievementOptimizer-1.20.1-1.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":9099,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"9gqqO8dL","user":{"id":"H8t5iidS","username":"bigenergy","name":"Big Energy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17977139?v=4","bio":"PHP/JS/Vue JS/Laravel/Java","created":"2023-04-26T13:31:25.398963Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"AchievementOptimizer-1.20.1-1.0.2.jar"},"mods\\vanity_aesthetic_armory-1.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"a9f9485cab94557fa40b2a23ba5e19aa2082b291bc9f52b4e2b2534a4762b17bf563479c64e23c4d998bf926756de9192f5375da7909c94e1bc00a7c5a95aa8b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"vEDzaSHn","slug":"vanity-aesthetic-armory","project_type":"mod","team":"DTwmyqQB","title":"Vanity: Aesthetic Armory","description":"Greatly expands the user's armory by providing new weapon, tool and armor skins for your favorite items.","body":"# Vanity: Aesthetic Armory\nAn Addon which adds multiple new shapes for your tools, following each tool tier.\nBy adding multiple tool skins unlocked by default, and three Designs that can be bought from Villagers, this Mod will allow your arsenal to be the most diverse and personalized it's ever been!\n\nThis pack's tool colors are from my resource pack, [Farcr's Re-Crafted](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/farcrs-re-crafted).

This mod has been tested to work on Windows and Mac. Other Gnome based Unix systems should work, too (1.18+ only). If your Linux system is not supported, running <code>apt-get install libgnome2-0</code> in terminal for installing the necessary components might just do the trick. If your system is not supported, worlds will be deleted using the vanilla method, meaning they're gone forever.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How can I tell whether my operating system is supported?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The delete world screen will tell you! If it gives you the option to move a world to the recycle bin/trash everything is supported. If you only see the vanilla delete world screen you're out of luck unfortunately.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UwE93yX.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>.

Villagers","description":"Village Pest Control","body":"Are you tired of your village dying off because its golem is too lazy?\n\nAre you tired of essentially defending it all by yourself?\n\nThis mod adds Guards as a solution, as well as new villager-related AI changes.\n\nAn * means a feature is configurable\n\n# Guards \nThese spawn in villages in groups of six, equipped with either an iron sword or a crossbow. They're prepared to fight any threat to the village (possibly including you!). To make new guards, crouch + right click on a nitwit or unemployed villager with a sword or crossbow.\n\nGuards can 'gossip' with villagers and will trust the player to open their inventory if they have a high enough reputation, have hero of the village, or is created by the player. Right clicking will open up the guard inventory, allowing you to give them armor, and swap out their weapons! For their offhand slot, you can either give them a shield, or some food. If they have a shield, they will use it to block attacks. Crossbow guards with a shield won't be able to kick enemies if they're blocking. If they have food (or a potion), they will start eating or drinking if they are low on health. Clicking the patrol button will allow you to set patrol points for guards, melee guards will walk around the point while ranged guards will snipe enemies and stand still on their point.\n\nIf you have hero of the village, they will gain the ability to follow and fight for you when you click the follow button.\n![Guard](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/images/0b0df1486eb77f265e6aef5b619288a83b548bb0.png)\n\n\n\n \n\n# AI Changes\nWitches attack villagers. *true by default \n\n\n\nIn raids, illagers kill any animal they see. *false by default \n\nVillagers and Illagers are scared of polar bears. *true by default \n\nClerics heal low-health guards, villagers, and players with Hero of the Village using regeneration potions, and smiths repair iron golems with ingots.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\nCan you port to an older version/fabric?\n\nNo. Maintaining one version is hard enough already, and I've never learned fabric. However, the mod's license permits you to make ports yourself. A fabric version of this mod also currently exists.\n\nCan you port to Windows 10 Edition/Xbox/Mobile?\n\nNo. Mods for the Bedrock ediiton use a completely different framework that I've also never learned. The mod's license allows you to try yourself, but since the modding API on Bedrock is less capable than forge you probably won't be able to replicate all of it.\n\nWhy don't guards have a workstation like other villager professions?\n\nI haven't thought of a suitable block that would let you have a large number of guards without being inconvenient to store.\n\nHow would you make guards spawn with modded equipment?\n\nYou can make them spawn with modded equipment by making a datapack that overrides the guard_chestplate, guard_helmet, guard_legs, guard feet, guard_main_hand or guard_off_hand json files. \n\nIs this mod compatible with X?\n\nTry and see!\n\n \n\n Special thanks to those in the MMD discord for helping me with some of the mods contents.","published":"2022-09-03T23:22:15.287365Z","updated":"2024-03-03T20:19:32.784586Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":62636,"followers":131,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["pBMhXHpy","FDyptF3C","h74EaSxg","tgvSxMbz","m5FPm7qd","VKAaGaUt","8FhU0wlh","CuWQRWRh","ZkNhijwC","d6rBM4Cg","FJBvRpmS","cwxNfyOe","F2iGn9UV","a6unnpep","V3WwPGO0","e2O5TKqU","APAV3nRX","HaGxOuRA","MUAGK1gz","wXjGQwVf","bhwMZR6g","ZXYzy1iR","7XuY8OQc","dYJvXrpF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/de6a0dca1d4d1f1e1c97409b51683cc7348797a6.png"},"version":{"id":"bhwMZR6g","project_id":"H1sntfo8","author_id":"9vwtx5vp","featured":false,"name":"Guard Villagers 1.20.1-1.6.4","version_number":"1.20.1-1.6.4","changelog":"- Fixed Golems not abiding reputation config option\n- Fixed Guards causing tps build up\n- Create es_mx (CANALETA)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-18T00:26:27.866183Z","downloads":4374,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"264d0e8576a21c81b11f199fa3331485749f059c","sha512":"3aaae74dae3bc3798db986a07efff0048442b288a90221434f886ffd50b5a3b090a8b8f093229a531567b0dc1332c3f592b3cd133a1e83c88746d0b3c3eae02d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H1sntfo8/versions/bhwMZR6g/guardvillagers-1.20.1-1.6.4.jar","filename":"guardvillagers-1.20.1-1.6.4.jar","primary":true,"size":200686,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DgYRJUTF","user":{"id":"9vwtx5vp","username":"seymourimadeit","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55965249?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T05:53:33.697802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"guardvillagers-1.20.1-1.6.4.jar"},"mods\\PickUpNotifier-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"3cddd0e7cd2527bf9483c2a4a40eb1d1e650c806fdfd3bcdf55cffdcc0575ca71d56a50d8d09cca63793e3da6b22436b636702755e0644beb4b0051f039a2dda","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZX66K16c","slug":"pick-up-notifier","project_type":"mod","team":"vMl4tbFC","title":"Pick Up Notifier","description":"Be notified about all the things you've just collected.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DCwxKZU.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Vz7MGCN.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

src=\"https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/banner.png\">\n\n## Overview\n\nDo a Barrel Roll is a lightweight, fully clientside mod that changes \nelytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.\nIt achieves this by redesigning movement with a \ncompletely unlocked camera orientation in mind, \nallowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.\n\n> ### Updated Forge version\n> Due to high demand, I've updated the Forge/NeoForge version of this mod to 1.20.\n> This version may not be permanently or actively maintained.\n> \n> If you want to use the config screen, make sure to install [Yet Another Config Lib **3.1.1 or lower**](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl/version/3.1.1+1.20-forge), as there is currently a bug with higher versions.\n\nSome subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,\nincluding but not limited to smoothing and banking.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra

being comfy at home? You usually would be forced to restart, even though you didn't really do anything wrong. Maybe\nyour friend didn't do anything wrong either. Overall I believe that death in hardcore is only fun if it feels like you\nreally deserved it, for example while fighting a strong boss monster.\n\nTherefore, this mod aims to solve this problem! When a player dies, instead of being gone for good, they enter a K.O.\nstate, at which point a timer will start running. Being the good friend you are, you can attempt to save them in time.\nIf you do, everything is fine - they get a small debuff and a strong appetite and you two can be on your way again. If\nyou don't, for example because you died while trying to save them, or you just didn't ~~care about your friend~~ get there\nin time, then that's your own fault and you can now decide to restart while in peace with yourself!\n\n## Features\n\n- Grace K.O. period before final death where your friends can save you\n- However, friends are not included :(\n- Locate the player and hold-right click to help them get back up\n- K.O. players can look around and chat, but can't move, attack nor use items\n- Works in both Hardcore and Normal mode","published":"2022-06-15T17:49:27.525608Z","updated":"2024-02-27T10:18:52.572909Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":52449,"followers":92,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["6wGmJftr","NPv6DtMw","EheMzhTn","Pt7Yl10p","crmxpfZM","Bqby8TEs","GTV9aS0F","ppBvqAiy","YneTLY3D","fomv8xij","VlxLLRoO","P1G5MTVn","S2nQZ3pG","rlfjV5SC","jnu2Xa9e","IlAX1bjq","TQPk4LHK","Q7CnwUKz","YF9Vy9lg","YtzcYRw1","emifT1am","cfQtO5gX","sEpTjpTP","juDG23u8","AFe7xCyA","e9UFcTbr","Gx2Drd8l","z3sWddTK","NQEKDc6z"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/HqKoXaXz/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"z3sWddTK","project_id":"HqKoXaXz","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"12.0.2+forge-1.20.1","version_number":"12.0.2+forge-1.20.1","changelog":"-

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2831230,"followers":4597,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":187847,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c","sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\ColdSweat-2.3-b02a.jar":{"sha512":"aff65443f6e63d493bd7f0cb5da643e6809c70a11973eaafaa0425f97851f005879eccfa2fbb8d101b2239107be413f855fa9d7bf0ea67a939f6eab422afd52f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Cold Sweat","description":"Cold Sweat is a highly-extensible temperature mod for Minecraft.

Here is a quick look through the changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhauled the music sheet GUI. Now it is a horizontal, scrolling sheet.</li>\n<li>You can now create <strong>MUCH longer</strong> music sheets. The upper limit is long enough to fit basically any music in a single sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>Note length</strong> is customizable! You can drag the mouse to set the length of each note.</li>\n<li>Multiple notes can be put at the same beat, and notes of different lengths can <strong>overlap</strong> in any way possible!</li>\n<li>TWICE the number of octaves. So, we are up from 4 to <strong>8 octaves</strong>. Note that not every instrument is suitable for every octave.</li>\n<li>Music sheets have a <strong>volume</strong> setting now.</li>\n<li>Each individual note also has a <strong>volume</strong> that can be set.</li>\n<li>Much more<strong> granular Tempo options</strong>, with an upper limit of 3000 BPM!</li>\n<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>new instruments</strong>: Redstone Guitar, Bass Guitar, Oboe and French Horn</li>\n<li>Advanced instrument playing GUI: You can now press <strong>multiple notes together</strong>, and <strong>releasing a key stops the note</strong>.</li>\n<li>Support for <strong>MIDI device input</strong> in the instrument GUI! Just connect your device and right click an instrument as normal.</li>\n<li>With 1.17.1-2.2, you can also use your MIDI device in the music sheet GUI as well! You can even record with it!</li>\n<li>The new record button in 1.17.1-2.2 allows you to<strong> record music in real time</strong> with your keyboard or a MIDI device.</li>\n<li>Middle clicking a note in the sheet GUI lets you view its <strong>real life notation</strong> name and edit it.</li>\n<li>Customizable <strong>measure lines</strong> in the music sheet GUI, for visual aid.</li>\n<li><strong>CTRL+Z to undo</strong> in the sheet GUI.</li>\n<li>A <strong>help button</strong> in the sheet GUI that explains the controls and keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li>Storage and network for the music sheets are handled more smartly now, consuming <strong>less resources</strong> than before, regardless of the length of a music.</li>\n<li>Loading an old world will <strong>automatically update</strong> all old music sheets to the new format on load. This is <strong>irreversible, </strong>so backup your world if you might want to play in an older version of the mod.</li>\n<li>Old copied musics can still be pasted in the new version (but not vice versa).</li>\n<li>Old exported sheet files can be imported in the new version (but not vice versa).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Note: </strong></span>If updating from an older version, I suggest you backup your world (or at least just the music sheets) before updating, in case there is a problem with the update process.</p>\n<hr /><hr />\n<h2>Features (before the huge update)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Music sheets that let you create music</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Sounds follow the chromatic scale with 12 notes per octave and&nbsp;4 octaves for a total of 48 notes</li>\n<li>&nbsp;11 different tempo settings from 60 BPM to 1200 BPM</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Writing music with the mouse or the keyboard, whichever you find comfortable</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Convenient keyboard functionality such as space, delete, backspace</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Selecting, copying and pasting notes. CTRL + A, CTRL + C, CTRL + V shortcuts work.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Copying between different sheets and even outside Minecraft. You can copy them to a text file to back up or paste in another world/server.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Putting up to 5 sheets in the hotbar to see and preview multiple layers of music at the same time when editing. Neighboring sheets can easily be disabled with a button that appears.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Previewing sheets with an instrument in the off hand. You can also lock the instrument per sheet to only preview with that instrument even when your off hand item changes. This can be used to mark which instrument a sheet is supposed to be played with and is also useful with neighboring sheets previews.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;13 craftable instruments and 1 instrument that can be found in certain treasures.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Using an instrument by itself plays a random note.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Using an instrument while holding a sheet with your offhand plays the sheet to the world.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Music boxes take in a sheet and an instrument. They start (or stop if playing already) playing when they take in a redstone signal that goes from off to on.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Music boxes also send a one second redstone pulse to their right face when they finish playing. This can be used to chain songs or activate piece of a contraption.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Metronomes supply a steady ticking when the redstone signal is on. The ticking rate can be set with a right click or using a music sheet on the metronome.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;After four tickings of a metronome, all nearby players that hold a music sheet with the correct tempo and an instrument will start playing synchronously. Use this to play songs together with your band.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Keyboard usage is as shown:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VvVz169/music-mod-keyboard.png\" alt=\"Keyboard Bindings\" width=\"480\" height=\"188\" />&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<h4><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/09rkM0z/music-recipes.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"818\" /></h4>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>LuchadorMickey</strong> for most of the graphics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>inuyasha01</strong> for the Chinese translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Greyberet</strong> for the Spanish translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Ste B </strong>for the Italian translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <span class=\"opened-by\"><strong>whiteevilbro</strong></span> for the Russian translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Szpieg2000</strong> for the Polish translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>FoxMcloud5655</strong> for back-porting changes to 1.16.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<div style=\"all: initial !important;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"all: initial !important;\">&nbsp;</div>","published":"2023-02-05T14:15:40.306769Z","updated":"2023-12-03T17:54:59.508576Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":43481,"followers":103,"categories":["decoration","game-mechanics","social"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["5xGpUT3o","VFv617TS","c62RBvbc","v4i8vz6N","vFsY5EDb","He8qxPaP","sH524ipB","1eMIAl3g","6WneoHVZ","Uu63sYWg","XT3XLTcW","Mt13SJH7","y5ILp4Ep","HshJamuy","E5VM3nf1","Kzq2EOKC","atsAXaFx","WeiESc7B","9ceNeRjO","vAdwlMhE","GAtc1v9U","lns17YWi","L9GiipeN","vkIE67gD","uzfwjdqC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qQpWCN75/5651c74521ed00c9d586f81f81cdecb099307291.png"},"version":{"id":"vkIE67gD","project_id":"qQpWCN75","author_id":"tIBCPzSw","featured":true,"name":"Music Maker Mod 1.20.1-1.0.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.1","changelog":"Fixed a bug with breaking empty music boxes.

Its main features are:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lPE3bSGgok\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Sleds\n- Sleds are new way to get around Snow. Differently from Boats they curve around the terrain they encounter making them able to smoothly climb up and down slopes.\n- When going downhill they will also accelerate further making ski courses possible.\n- Sleds have improved mobility on Ice and while being able to slide on Snow are still able to steer and you can even bring them to a full stop by rotating the sled by 90 degrees, as you would in real life!\n- Chests can be placed on them to give some inventory space. Also works with Shulker Boxes and Sacks from Supplementaries.\n- You can also attach a tamed Wolf with a Lead to it. When Sleds are pulled by Wolves they will have increase mobility, speed and will be able to climb up with minimal deceleration.\n- Igloos can now spawn with an additional Sled with Chest in front that can contain some sweet winter loot.\n- Sleds can be further customized by placing Carpets on top of them. Doing so will additionally prevent freezing when sledding on top of frigid Powdered Snow.\n\n### Villagers AI\n\n- During winter time villagers will occasionally place down Wreaths on their house doors. They can only place one each and don't worry, they will clean them up when winter is over. Wreath placing can happen during idle time so at around 0 for example.\n- If you have Supplementaries installed villagers will also place down Present blocks containing some cool items. They will only be able to place one Present each and will do so during their meet time (after 9000) around their meeting point.\n- Baby villagers from Taiga and Tundra will throw Snowballs at any entity they see during their play time.\n- \"Winter Time\" is a period of time which can be configured with the provided configs and by default goes from the 20th of December to the 30th of January.\n- If you have Serene Seasons installed you can also make the mod follow its seasons instead.\n\n### Winter themed blocks\n\n- Ginger: a new crop that can be crafted into Gingerbread Blocks, a new decorative block. Wild Ginger can be found in Sparse Jungle biomes.\n- Gumdrops: they come in all colors and can be pushed by entities acting as a mix between a Button and a Pressure Plate that works on all directions.\n- Candy Cane: a sweet looking item, literally. Can be crafted in decorative Candy Cane Blocks.\n- Wreaths: can be placed on doors to bring some Christmasy joy to your house. Works with all modded doors as well.\n- Glow Lights: an item that can be placed on any Leaves to give it some glow in the dark action. Can be removed with Shears or broken.\n- Snow Globe: a block that will change to its snowy state when placed in places where it can snow.\n- New music disc: a new winter themed music disc has been added and can be rarely found in Presents and Igloo Sled Chests.\n\n> This project was made during WinterJam 2021\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n##

Entity Model Features 1.3","version_number":"1.3","changelog":"- added the `EMFAnimationApi` which allows other mods to register their own custom animation variables and functions to EMF\n  - variables can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi` \n    - via a `FloatSupplier` for simple number variables \n    - via a `BooleanSupplier` for simple boolean variables\n    - via a custom variable factory if your variable requires more complex logic, such as reading complex variable names or giving different results for different contexts\n  - functions can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi`\n    - via a `Function<Float, Float>` for simple functions witn 1 argument\n    - via a `BiFunction<Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 2 arguments\n    - via a `TriFunction<Float, Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 3 arguments\n    - via a `Function<List<Float>, Float>` for functions with a variable amount of arguments provided via a List<Float>\n    - via a  custom function factory if your function requires more complex logic, such as reading the argument strings as a value other than float\n- changed the `unknown model printing` option to `Model exporting` and added options to export all models info to a .jem file or the log, not just the unknown / modded ones\n  - Models now export `Blockbench` ready with correct pivots, boxes, and uvs.\n  - models now export to `.minecraft/emf/export/`\n- implemented `is_on_head`, `is_in_hand` & `is_in_item_frame`, which did nothing before\n- fixed a `\"newstate\" is null` crash\n- added the `Animation LOD distance` setting which allows you to set the distance at which EMF will start skipping animation frames to save performance\n- added the `Retain LOD at low fps` setting which will proportionally reduce the impact of the above LOD setting while the game is running at below 60 fps, as skipped frames can become more noticeable at lower fps\n- reworked the config screen to use sliders where appropriate\n- added `wolf_armor` to the OptiFine name mappings\n- invalid texture overrides will no longer cause the model to fail to load but instead log an error and use the vanilla texture\n- EMF log messages are now prefixed with a shorter `[EMF]`\n- temporarily disabled texture overrides with tridents as they are broken and difficult to troubleshoot\n- added debug render option `Wireframe over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time\n- added debug render option `Wireframe flashing over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time but the wireframe fades in and out\n- emf now correctly reads all texture overrides with the various relative paths set by optifine e.g. `./`, `~/` etc\n- added a config setting *(enabled by default)* that allows EMF to modify the `enhanced block entity (EBE)` mod's config to disable it for block entities that have custom EMF models loaded\n- fixed texture overrides acting weird with feature renderers *(fixes Ewan's entity health bars cem models with villagers)*\n- added `left_ear` & `right_ear` to `head_piglin.jem` which seems to be correct but missing in OptiFine's documentation :/\n- reduced and reworded some of the loading log spam that would worry users *(for example Fresh Animations 1.9 now sends no log errors on load)*\n- added EMF only rotational logic functions for radians and degrees `wrapdeg() wraprad() degdiff() raddiff()`\n  - the `wrap` functions will wrap a rotation value down to it's smallest identical value, e.g. `wrapdeg(370)` will return `10` & `wrapdeg(350)` will return `-10`\n  - the `diff` functions will return the resulting difference between two rotation values factoring in the rotation, e.g. `degdiff(10, 350)` will return `-20` & `degdiff(10, 370)` will return `0` \n- added very many EMF only interpolation animation functions\n  - `catmullrom() quadbezier() cubicbezier() hermite() easeinoutexpo() easeinexpo() easeoutexpo() easeinoutcirc() easeincirc()  easeoutcirc()  easeinoutelastic()  easeinelastic()  easeoutelastic()  easeinoutback() easeinback()  easeoutback()  easeinoutbounce()  easeinbounce()  easeoutbounce()  easeinquad()  easeoutquad()  easeinoutquad()  easeincubic()  easeoutcubic()  easeinoutcubic()  easeinquart()  easeoutquart()  easeinoutquart()  easeinquint()  easeoutquint()  easeinoutquint()  easeinsine()  easeoutsine()  easeinoutsine()`\n  - hermite & catmullrom have 5 args, the bezier's have 4, the rest have 3, and all are used in the same way as `lerp()` with the delta value being the first argument.\n  - this is a good website to get an idea on what most of these look like https://easings.net/\n- `e` variable added\n- fixes for a certain mixin causing crashes\n- EMF now supports modifying modded block entity models which use the vanilla block entity models separately from the vanilla ones\n  - *(e.g. the `lootr` mod's chest

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you.

This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

Developers:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; white-space: pre;\"><strong>This guide should only be used if you are a developer wanting to using Blueprint in your mod. If you're a player, you may disregard this guide.</strong><br />Adding Blueprint to your mod is quite simple! First off you need to add Blueprint as a dependency to access the library in code. To do so, add the following into your <code>build.gradle</code>: <br /><br /><code>\nrepositories {<br />\n    maven {<br />\n        url = \"https://maven.jaackson.me\"<br />\n    }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\ndependencies {<br />\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"com.teamabnormals:blueprint:&lt;version&gt;\")<br />\n}\n      </code><br /> <br />Next you need to add it as a dependecy on Forge to make your mod require Blueprint when loading. In your <code>mods.toml</code> add the following block to the file:<br /><br /><code>\n[[dependencies.&lt;modId&gt;]]<br />\n    modId = \"blueprint\"<br />\n    mandatory = true<br />\n    versionRange = \"[&lt;version&gt;,)\"<br />\n    ordering = \"BEFORE\"<br />\n    side = \"BOTH\"\n      </code><br /><br />Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> in the examples above with the version on you want. For example, <code>1.17.1-4.0.0</code> will give us <code>blueprint-1.17.1-4.0.0.jar</code>. The example for the <code>mods.toml</code> is targeting the version selected and any versions beyond. If you want to target it differently, you may want to read up on the <code>mods.toml</code> spec. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Nodecraft\" href=\"https://nodecraft.com/r/abnormals\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oZS1R9g.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-09-18T17:11:12.586856Z","updated":"2024-02-29T23:39:10.374756Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":21422,"followers":47,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["LeFEEsj6","SnLXbWe9","W7LnjQML","aCCwv4Kz","mnMEKjNd","fEmF971j","L7ot1xtH","fHbqAHAN"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/9311df94e37aa2c7a39cce14d118a263862fe9e5.png"},"version":{"id":"W7LnjQML","project_id":"VsM5EDoI","author_id":"q5duvarF","featured":false,"name":"Blueprint 7.0.0","version_number":"7.0.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T00:24:08.207392Z","downloads":4667,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5cf7ab755a9ef27f817c772dbe3d0b6f3d972b21","sha512":"8734846b80ab69f2f6ef199d0fbbe18bf12433e7da64c7f511ed5c9ce8b021d5045003f7199f476e469e3e092b6669b9aabb2d2f4fc14b7b449cb203d3355acd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/versions/W7LnjQML/blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.0.jar","filename":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.0.jar","primary":true,"size":958371,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"3u8PgG8F","username":"bagel","name":"bagel","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/3u8PgG8F/3c735084680f47dea218cca869655cfc245cd051.png","bio":"minecraft modder and coder and yeaher","created":"2021-04-29T17:41:22.849292Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"P53hwL9b","username":"SmellyModder","name":"Luke Tonon","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/P53hwL9b/02d85c2d067251dc276beec1c53ebf4ae05bcfb8.png","bio":"Software Developer, Game Developer, and Modder.\r\nMaking dreams come true.","created":"2023-09-18T18:52:46.978373Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"q5duvarF","username":"TeamAbnormals","name":"teamabnormals","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/q5duvarF/eba25e566c8678da285243ac416844c84dc7ef9d.png","bio":"We're a modding team dedicated to creating with high-quality art and design for modern Minecraft versions!","created":"2023-09-18T16:48:51.416757Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.0.jar"},"mods\\CreativeCore_FORGE_v2.11.24_mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"09ca405b68121880ef0ab1a7cf7426ed0dca5fbb1275aa53642f9df9e79d5635f3a3cd8507c0cecb620f534e277ec2017f7c7639a9e7b9f8df839b9c04beb40d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OsZiaDHq","slug":"creativecore","project_type":"mod","team":"FvoHe2qM","title":"CreativeCore","description":"A core mod","body":"Nothing else than a simple core mod required by most of CreativeMD's mods.\n\n**Features**\n* Gui-Api\n* Config System (/cmdconfig or /cmdclientconfig)\n* Packet system (supports splitted packets)\n* Event system (by N247s)\n* Ingredients\n* Fake world\n\nI know everybody hates core mods, because it is an additional file you have to download, but it speeds up my progress.

when a lava drop lands\n- Adds the ability to configure the rate of drip particle spawning\n- In 1.17+, the sounds for water/lava drips use the Dripstone sounds by default, and there is an option to

configurable mod allowing your server's players (and admins) to change their nickname with \nfull Simplified Text Formatting support. It supports LuckPerms, PlayerRoles or any other \nfabric permission api compatible mod, with automatic removal of nicknames for players without permissions.\nIf you have any questions, you can ask them on my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AbqPPppgrd)\n\n\n## Commands (and permissions):\n- `/styled-nicknames` - Main command (`stylednicknames.main`, available by default)\n- `/styled-nicknames reload` - Reloads configuration (requires `stylednicknames.reload`)\n- `/styled-nicknames set <player> <value>` - Changes target players nickname (requires `stylednicknames.change_others`)\n- `/styled-nicknames clears <player>` - Clears target players nickname (requires `stylednicknames.change_others`)\n- `/nickname set <value>`/`/nick set <value>` - Changes own nickname (requires `stylednicknames.use`)\n- `/nickname clear`/`/nick clear` - Clears own nickname (requires `stylednicknames.use`)\n\n## Configuration:\nYou can find config file in `./config/styled-nicknames.json`.\n[Formatting uses PlaceholderAPI's Simplified Text Format for which docs you can find here](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/).\n\n```json5\n{\n    \"CONFIG_VERSION_DONT_TOUCH_THIS\": 1,\n    \"allowByDefault\": false,           // Enables player commands by default\n    \"defaultPrefix\": \"#\",              // Default prefix of nickname\n    \"maxLength\": 32,                   // Max length (without formatting) of the nickname, set to 0 to disable it \n    \"changeDisplayName\": true,         // Changes player's display name\n    \"changePlayerListName\": false,     // Changes nickname in player list (This option will be incompatible with some mods, use placeholder instead when possible)\n    \"allowLegacyFormatting\": false,    // Allows usage of legacy text format in nicknames (&X)\n    \"nicknameChangedMessage\": \"...\",   // Message send after changing nickname\n    \"nicknameResetMessage\": \"...\",     // Message send after clearing nickname\n    \"defaultEnabledFormatting\": {\n      /*\"tagname\": value*/                // These values allow you to change tags enabled by default\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Permission\nTo use commands/permissions, players require `stylednicknames.use` to use commands and \noptionally permissions `stylednicknames.format.[tag_name]` (`[tagname]` is Simplified Text Format tag), \nfor additional formatting.\n\nYou can also give `stylednicknames.ignore_limit` to disable nickname length limit for them (which already ignores tags).\n\nYou should also give `stylednicknames.change_others` permission to your admins, so they can remove bad nicknames","published":"2021-09-02T18:53:26.395942Z","updated":"2023-12-04T13:20:57.985066Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":48519,"followers":112,"categories":["social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-rc2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-rc1","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["AxfrQLFd","cUpLgUQC","uwuBRLx9","TgbNseCI","2efrP185","QZWN4OFQ","hi7O2gPP","LCCWv7f2","ZAebiU4g","9k8RQJkW","qQ3CDb00","R7dIzguo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/DOk6Gcdi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"9k8RQJkW","project_id":"DOk6Gcdi","author_id":"L8RLwrF2","featured":false,"name":"1.2.1+1.20","version_number":"1.2.1+1.20","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-04T17:22:57.320139Z","downloads":11981,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7b2ee0d4d03fd2f5463baa5eb83b2781f86b061811db52b27126a92c6bf4dac177e5e149e04473b42774a49693ffa976e9626c9feef2429870e0f565cedaa176","sha1":"737962952717aedd849797b3351ceaae925099f2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOk6Gcdi/versions/9k8RQJkW/styled-nicknames-1.2.1%2B1.20.jar","filename":"styled-nicknames-1.2.1+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":157070,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fJIcH4yD","user":{"id":"L8RLwrF2","username":"Patbox","name":"Patbox","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/39821509?v=4","bio":"Minecraft modder specializing in server side development.

All code is open source and documented. Some of its features include:\n\n### 📚 Read the Structure Gel API Documentation Here\n\nFor an open source working example of this api, check out [Dungeons Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeons-plus)\n\nYou can find detailed information on how to develop and use this API by Minecraft version.\n\n**Latest Documentation**\n- [1.16+](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.16)\n\n**Older Documentation**\n- [1.15.2](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.15)\n- [1.14.4](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.14)\n\n## 🧪 Latest Features\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWO5BqSd29E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## 🛠️ Building Tools\n\n**The Building Tool is a new creative mode only item used to perform various large scale block alterations.**\n\n- It can be found in the Structure Items creative mode tab.\n- Right click the Building Tool in the air to open the GUI. Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## 🍡 Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## 🍮 Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build. If this structure were loaded into the game, the gel inside would be replaced with air, while the air outside would not be placed.\n\n![house_example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/d825a427e103a45857cc527bd3027f3736bc2eb1.gif)<br>\n\nThe code for this block is designed in a way such that you can easily extend it and hook into its behavior with methods in blocks.IStructureGel, should you need behavior not already implemented.\n\nThis is a core mod that modifies a few internal classes. If you get a crash with this mod that only occurs when mixed with another mod, this may be the cause. Please test before reporting.\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2023-05-21T23:11:08.916649Z","updated":"2024-02-04T18:56:20.054195Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":129083,"followers":31,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rrIuQG5f","YtlOh5ib","n7xrHFAI","hoSPdpVk","sC5VyD3U","Yj94wn7H","bsBVjIWk","bgOjiT8y","pCNl93Ka","DjvKx9sL","p2hBgWM7","Wcqj3c1P","czn0eUba","CrRybArg","WdmDpRR4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/80dbc0d2d3acadcfcfc1bfa79488f0d353bac1ea.png"},"version":{"id":"Wcqj3c1P","project_id":"T8TGycIQ","author_id":"QlRPeSYG","featured":false,"name":"Structure Gel API v2.16.0","version_number":"2.16.0","changelog":"# 1.20.1-v2.16.0\n\n## LoadStructureTemplateEvent\n- New event that fires after a `StructureTemplate` loads.\n- Contains methods to modify the blocks and entities within the template.\n\n## Gel Blocks\n- Now automatically perform their function without needing to implement the structure processor or use a specific StructurePiece type. \n\t- If the processor is already present, it will still use that.\n\t- This will not be done when loading a template through Structure Blocks or the `place template` command.\n\n## IModifyState\n- Any `TemplateStructurePiece` that extends `IModifyState` will now work with it as long as the `postProcess` method isn't overwritten.\n\n## Data Handler\n- All handlers can now mark blocks for post processing in the Properties menu. \n\t- Useful for making sure water flows after being placed, or updating fence connections for neighboring structures.\n\t- The position marked for post processing will be the position of the data handler itself, with the applied offset.\n- Added `structure_gel:empty` as an empty data handler.\n\t- Its primary function is to set an offset and mark a position for post processing.\n\t- This is not used by default if the data handler can't be loaded from nbt.\n- Fixed the `structure_gel:block_state` using `structure_gel:chest` for its data parser.\n\n## Building Tool\n- The Shape tool now has Hollow Cube, Cube Frame, Pyramid, and Cone.\n\t- Changing the shape now uses a selection panel instead of clicking to cycle to the next value.\n- The Fill tool now supports all the shapes from the Shape tool for fine control over shapes (replaces the old Mode property).\n- The Clone tool now temporarily saves its selected region into a clipboard.\n\t- This allows for cloning to an area far away, regardless of the source being loaded.\n\t- The region is not actually saved to the item itself, but rather to an external file in the dimension's `data` folder..\n\t- This results in drastic client performance improvements, especially for large selections.\n- The Replace tool now has a \"Fuzzy\" property that allows only replacing directly attached neighbors or diagonal neighbors.\n- Fixed a number of vertex sorting issues with the Clone tool.\n- Translatable text values in the GUI's now scroll like vanilla options buttons.\n- Action history is no longer stored in a level capability. It has been moved to `SavedData` files to allow for more dynamic loading.\n\n## Block Entities\n- Added `IRotatable` interface.\n\t- Allows a block entity to be rotated and mirroed when placed in a structure.\n\t- Contains `void mirror(Mirror)` and `void rotate(Rotate)`.\n\t- Supported by vanilla's `StructureTemplate` (mixin), `GelTemplate`, relavent data handlers, and relavent Building Tool modes.\n\n## Misc\n- Added an abstract item interface: `StructureFinderItem`\n\t- Contains basic methods to get/set located structure info within itself.\n- Improved performance with data handler processing.\n- Some registry events have been deprecated. They will become NeoForge registries in 1.20.4.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-22T08:10:47.454204Z","downloads":19585,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d5d3ada50c8e0f05065e7d5e51619d6c6e71d16cb70a571350172c5ef1a577c52ceb0b9e54b9fcf16fb15d7354db3629dabcb7016ed8cf45665bcb15f2d75891","sha1":"cf2225192e43316ab2ce99368eb7c59b4b08ac58"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/versions/Wcqj3c1P/structure_gel-1.20.1-2.16.0.jar","filename":"structure_gel-1.20.1-2.16.0.jar","primary":true,"size":961824,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"JuGQbIAJ","user":{"id":"QlRPeSYG","username":"SilverDavidMC","name":"Silver_David","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15661705?v=4","bio":"Programmer and artist for Modding Legacy.

And can be used as an optimization tool if certain items cause lag.\n\n### Specific Configs\n- **Disable Items Completely.** You can blacklist items to be removed with all features above.\n- **Disable Only Specific NBT in Items.** You can blackliist items that have specific NBT tags. Works with regex too!\n- **Disable Only Item Attacks.** You can blacklist items to only disable its attacks.\n- **Disable Only Item Interaction.** You can blacklist items to only disable interactions (Right-Click).\n- **Disable Only Recipes.** You can blacklist recipes only if they contain the item.\n \n\n## FAQ\n\n\n- **Can I use this in my modpack?**\n  \nOf course! It was designed for modpack creators to remove undesired items that may unbalance the game or create issues.\n\n \n\n- **Client or server?**\n\nThe mod is needed on both client and server. As it has some client features, but also server ones.\n\nCan work server-side only, but JEI/REI/EMI and creative tab removals won't work.\n\n \n\n- **What if I mispell an item ID in the config file?**\n\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the item won't be blacklisted as it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n\n\n## Example Configuration:\n\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each item you want to obliterate.\n\nItems can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:golden_apple\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"item_obliterator.json5\" (>=2.0.0) or \"item_obliterator.json\" (< 2.0.0)\n\n![Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050578253489917992/1197387350930620456/image.png)","published":"2023-04-27T01:18:17.693047Z","updated":"2024-01-24T14:10:48.936137Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":81249,"followers":79,"categories":["management"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","optimization","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["wStgh7KF","Z7O1PDF6","DhBs53zu","apfGL9jJ","TF654Ypi","hvb70HnH","pdDz3IHw","OgSArgH9","C1RqeDeY","9VoRHOKh","AttOhwKN","3Da2NymJ","PPE0fiKq","YOjk8208"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3ESR84kR/3262d2940ea87e5c5e33addce1f1a52d03366ded.png"},"version":{"id":"C1RqeDeY","project_id":"3ESR84kR","author_id":"Kp5oK4eX","featured":false,"name":"Item Obliterator 1.7.0","version_number":"1.7.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-15T07:17:10.863729Z","downloads":2952,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"91a6e206d88a8ec8c0781a8e216fb5966dc128a44834bbf0afb1bc419ec28bf4204e4345b42adebbb804b1b2f630b35f4fba45b136a12336a9bb094c5b7accbb","sha1":"0a9bb56ba259a58ae61035d4d5695f8e6eb90772"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3ESR84kR/versions/C1RqeDeY/Item_Obliterator-FORGE-MC1.20.1-1.7.0.jar","filename":"Item_Obliterator-FORGE-MC1.20.1-1.7.0.jar","primary":true,"size":19728,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"eMo39BOz","user":{"id":"Kp5oK4eX","username":"ElocinDev","name":"Nicole","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Kp5oK4eX/e5c22c1a3b936e38de559ce58eec20f6a766470b.png","bio":"Mod developer working @ Luna Pixel Studios","created":"2022-11-10T10:48:24.447467Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"eMo39BOz","user":{"id":"GpOHZG9G","username":"LunaPixelStudios","name":"Luna Pixel Studios","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135580893?v=4","bio":"https://discord.gg/LunaPixel","created":"2023-06-05T06:00:30.865746Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Studio","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Item_Obliterator-FORGE-MC1.20.1-1.7.0.jar"},"mods\\monobank-1.20.1-1.1.4.jar":{"sha512":"db72b4781f2045b2dde7ae6547e91cab95103c414fe6c81d573a571fe077ce783147aa492fc7ff34b099a823574851f1d3431ad80e723b342ea602927bc1c766","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3bSjQuE3","slug":"monobank","project_type":"mod","team":"TvMUbsb1","title":"Monobank","description":"Your personal safe* storage.","body":"<img  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mortuusars/Monobank/master/media/main.png\" width=250/>\n\n### Your personal safe* storage.\n###### _*Storage may not be 100% safe.

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? \n[Check out this list!](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives)\n\n### What's this name?\n\nNow the name wasn't even born in the beginning, it was going to be called TexTrue's Dynamic Lights, but I don't really like having anything named after me, and then I started to think about combining Dynamic Lights with other Japanese anime character names, and realized that Ryo Yamada (\"Bocchi The Rock!\" Kessoku Band's bassist) was the best choice (maybe?).\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with  [ObsidianUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/obsidianui)\n, (and [Sodium (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Embeddium (Forge/NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via Mod List, you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\n## 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Embeddium (Forge/NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) is recommended for better performances.\n- Incompatible when set `experimentalForgeLightPipelineEnabled = true` in `forge-client.toml`.([#11](https://github.com/ThinkingStudios/RyoamicLights/issues/11))\n- **OptiFine/OptiForge/OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n","published":"2023-09-16T08:14:10.650962Z","updated":"2024-03-09T10:51:32.311881Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":41300,"followers":58,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["m7Lgm8hK","LZLtVgqa","nIO7QC7M","igllhLFS","1erCetvG","zWFbKQhD","RhNYCcIM","7dqU8eac","BgMtpRGo","DdwTwijv","bwlFgqWO","L5KtvJvn","IZqfjY96","jsZuXFzy","uzzXZrCs","RrIca7qx","cYFh4a2b","YgHO99D8","kgF8B46D","T4KlCMzj","18FTecpJ","xoCdiQHY","bhpUY0SA","d4rDqsnh","1HYIaLuU","BzdfpZfe","BAVFDr9B","8xdhlPCJ","iN95aGh4","Q5QeW2N7","urYBzvtU","moeCujqS","Q3dbVMx1","gL4xb5aw","29VEzD1q","sS8xNLfi","oN4QkegK","IQ1uiXHc","3nMO9jfc","AMvRSg7p","doJw68CH","YyRYjgpq","X857RLfZ","qO6GwRlw","wGVPnuOQ","HOHsa6Ij","CbDFbHrH","GXdBQIBF","Uz6TYn6f","UGTsNdUR","euzZ7R0y","aMDVprYS","WRwefikH"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/reCfnRvJ/64f306245c75a736036263299e6312318a3a05c5.png"},"version":{"id":"WRwefikH","project_id":"reCfnRvJ","author_id":"oOhH1tPz","featured":false,"name":"[Forge]

Storage","description":"Simple mass storage without the hassle of tech mods - plus a bunch of other sky-related additions.","body":"![Cloud Storage](https://i.imgur.com/l64Hx8K.gif)\n\nMany people have heard of Cloud Storage, but many believe that it involves computers and servers and other smart people stuff. In reality, and in this mod, Cloud Storage involves tying a chest, barrel or other inventory to a balloon and sending it up to the cloud. Why? So you can access its inventory from your home, without the need of a complicated network of meteorite-sourced crystals, something you traded with elves through a portal, or even a gigantic chest.\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is this mod exactly?</summary>\n\nThis mod is an easy to use solution to the storage problem. Rather than gating our nearly-endless storage systems behind tech mod stuff or endgame content, most of it can be easily crafted from new items dropped by new mobs that shouldn't be much of a challenge to defeat by most players. Although storage is the main reason you'd play with this mod, there is additional content added such as new foods, pets, blocks, mechanics, music disc etc. that are all thoroughly polished and fit the theme and aesthetic of both the mod and Minecraft itself.\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Getting Started</summary>\n\nIf you get confused by such a simple mod or don't want this website constantly open in the other tab, I'd recommend you craft the in-game guide book:\n\n\n![in game guide book recipe](https://i.imgur.com/nU4JUOE.png)\n\nThis book is written by yours truly and should be a better guide than this mod description. But if you insist...\n\nThe first major addition of cloud storage are two mobs that drop the main materials required to create balloons, cloud chests, etc. Meet the Badloon and the Bloviator.\n![Badloon and Bloviator](https://i.imgur.com/cUFQCIm.png)\nBadloons are angry, yet fragile balloon monsters that attempt to punch you with their single glove, in hopes of knocking you off to your doom. However, they can be easily popped with any projectile and are deathly afraid of cactus. Badloons drop 0-2 balloon pieces when killed.\n\nBloviators are hostile cloud spirits that will attempt to spew gusts of wind at you to push you away - although this does no damage in itself, it is quite a nuisance. But if the weather turns from clear skies to rain, the bloviator will enter its charged, thundercloud form, zapping you with lightning instead. When killed, big bloviators split into smaller ones, just like slimes. The smallest ones have a chance of dropping a Cloud Block, and the thunder-y ones can drop a Static Cloud Block.\n\nBoth of these monsters only spawn at y-level 196 and above (spawning is highly configurable), so you will have to climb high into the sky to find them. Once you have enough of their respective drops, you're going to need to craft at least two balloons and one cloud chest, like so:\n![balloon and cloud chest recipe](https://i.imgur.com/ojv52TM.png)\n\nThen, simply dye the balloons any color of your choosing(or don't, I'm a mod author, not a cop) and tie one to a normal chest under the sky to send it to the cloud. Once the chest has reached world height and been uploaded to the cloud, you should be able to access all of its 27 slots by placing the balloon of the same color inside the cloud chest. Note that this only works if the cloud chest has skylight access! When you need more space, simply tie another balloon of the same color to a chest and send it upwards. By default, cloud chests can hold up to 4096 slots (configurable of course) - which is a lot of items.\n\n![Cloud Chest interface](https://i.imgur.com/zncmMfX.gif)\n\nCloud chests can be scrolled through, sorted, and searched in order to find any item you need.\n\nCloud chests themselves are private storage - like an ender chest, they are exclusive to you and cannot be opened by other players, or accessed by hoppers. Luckily, if you need something like that, there is the static cloud chest, made in the same way as the cloud chest but with static cloud blocks. These can be accessed by hoppers, pipes, other players, etc. as they are static and the same for everyone. To upload to the static inventory, you will need a statically-charged balloon, which you can get by rubbing a balloon against a static cloud.\n\nSince static cloud chests can be accessed from anywhere by hoppers, they can be used as instantaneous item transport beyond two far points, such as two separate bases, or a sky mob farm.\n\nBalloons have other uses too, such as slowing your fall speed and reducing fall damage, and can be tied to fences and stands for decoration. Cloud blocks also can be used to reduce fall height.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Additional Fun Content</summary>\n\nAn additional new mob is added, the Balloon Buddy, who can be crafted and will be your best friend forever and ever. They have 8 possible personalities which dictate how they behave, fight, etc.\n\nIn villages, you can find the Balloon Salesman, who can trade you a variety of cloud storage - related items, along with his own propeller hat. Sometimes, they can offer a map to a temple in the sky or a big balloon, which has a unique loot chest and mob spawner (1.18.2 only)\n\nCotton candy is a new food source that can be crafted from sugar and cloud blocks. It's fun to eat but I'm not a fan of the taste.\n\nYou can use some of the bottled clouds to create a new tool called the Cloud Blower. But I don't understand how you could possibly have fun with one of those oversized hairdryers...\n\nIf a badloon is popped by a skeleton, it can drop a unique new music disc.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Credits</summary>\n \n- Yosh: Art assets\n- FallenReaper: Art assets\n- Carro1001: Art assets\n- Crydigo: Art assets\n- Shroomy: Music disc\n-

📘About:\nSully’s Mod started out a few years ago when I decided to try and make a mod. I couldn’t think of a name and called it the first name that came to my head as a placeholder “Sully”, the name stuck and now people think my name is actually Sully. <br/> \nBack then it was made with MCreator and combined with the fact that I back then didn’t have a good understanding of vanilla feel, it became more limited each version. I decided to completely revamp the mod, completely dumping the MCreator version and getting a coding team (Uraneptus and MiteBeMana). <br/>\nWith each feature I try to think it out as well as I can, making sure the feature is well-balanced, feels fun to play with and overall just feels like something new. It tries it’s best to feel like a Minecraft update full of random features. The mod is planned to have features for every player, explorers, builders and redstone engineers.\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## 📝Current Features:\n\n**[Disclaimer the mod is currently in it's beta so many features are not yet implemented, check out this doc if you want to know more about the planned features: [Planned](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0-PYvZDjAtcMZySJMDEGL2xQSIM8Znr9rzibRzqDeA/edit?usp=drivesdk)]**\n\n**• Jade**\n\n**• Jade Flinger Totem**\n\n**• Jade Shield**\n\n**• Jade Horse Armor**\n\n**• Copper Buttons**\n\n**• Laternfish**\n\n**• Tortoise**\n\n**• Tortoise Shell**\n\n**• Bouldering Zombie**\n\n**• Jungle Spider**\n\n\n_If you want to know more about the indiviudal features, check our wiki out: [Sully's Mod Wiki](https://github.com/Uraneptus/Sullys-Mod/wiki)_\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## 💼 Dev team:\n\n**Sully:** _Art, Animations, Game Design, Sound Design_ \\[[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModSully)]\n\n**Uraneptus:** _Code, Additional Sound Design, Mod Icon/Banner, Documentation_ [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uraneptus2)]\n\n**MiteBeMana:** _Code, Additional Game Design_ [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MiteBeMana)]\n\n**KekeCreations:** Code [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CreationsKeke)]\n\n**A full list of all Contributors can be found here:** [Credits Page](https://github.com/Uraneptus/Sullys-Mod/wiki/Credits)\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## 📋FAQ:\n\n**\"What is planned for the remake?\"**\n- Here is a doc with all of the planned concepts that are done: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0-PYvZDjAtcMZySJMDEGL2xQSIM8Znr9rzibRzqDeA/edit?usp=drivesdk) <br/>\nThere is more to come though!\n\n**\"Why are you remaking the mod?\"**\n- Check this twitter thread out: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModSully/status/1483351756033732611)\n\n**\"For which minecraft version will the mod be remade?\"**\n- 1.18+.

Editing/Creating a macro takes effect instantly, no need to relaunch.\n\nKeys are not limited to a single macro, multiple macros can be bound to the same key to have multiple commands run at once.\n\nDifferent Types of Macros:\n- Delayed Macro: Command has a configurable delay between key press and execution.\n\n- Repeating Macro: Command while auto repeat while holding down the key. Delay configurable\n\n- Toggled Repeating: Same as Repeating but the key press acts as a toggle, allowing the command to repeat without holding down the key\n\n- RunNTimes(New in 1.6.0!): Command will run N times when pressed.

I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods if you would like to discuss, provide suggestions, etc.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGenerally Embeddium should work out of the box with many more mods than Rubidium. However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n*
