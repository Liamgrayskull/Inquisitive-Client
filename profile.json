Well you came to the right place!\n\nThis Mod serves as an addon to many popular mods and is meant to fill in the gaps by adding all the blocks that such mods add in all wood types currently installed.\n\nEvery block type added is available in ALL wood types.\n\nWith this mod you won't need extra compatibility addons and instead only rely on a single universal one! It's all automatic!\n\nAdditionally the mod will try to convert any block from other uninstalled compat mods into its equivalent ones.\n\n<center>\n\n## ü™ë Supported Blocksü™ë\n</center>\n\n### Quark\n- Posts\n- Stripped posts\n- Hedges\n- Bookshelves\n- Vertical Planks\n- Ladders\n- Chests\n\n### Farmers Delight\n- Cabinets\n\n### Twilight Forest\n- Hollow Logs\n- Banisters\n\n### Decorative Blocks\n- Seats\n- Palisades\n- Supports\n- Beams\n\n### Architects Palette\n- Boards\n- Railings\n\n### Valhesia Structures\n- Posts\n- Cut Posts\n\n### Another Furniture\n- Tables\n- Chairs\n- Shelves\n- Flower Boxes\n- Shutters\n- Drawers\n- Benches\n\n### Storage Drawers\n- Drawers\n\n### Furnish\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Builders and Craft Additions\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Mosaic Carpentry\n- Mosaics\n\n### MrCrayfish Furniture Mod\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Twigs\n- Tables\n\n### Macaw's Mods\n- Fences\n- Windows\n- Bridges\n- Lights\n- Paths\n- Furnitures\n- Rooves\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ùì F. A. Q. ‚ùì\n</center>\n\nQ: How the heck does this work?\n> A: Magic.\n\nQ: Is this compatible with other compat mods?\n> A: Yes, I've included a list of many popular compat mods. The mod will do its best not to register stuff that's already in them when they are installed\n\nQ: I'm a mod author, could I use this mod to add support to my blocks?\n> A: Yes! The mod includes a very simple and easy to use API with which modders can register an entire block definition in only 10 lines! The mod will automatically generate all assets automatically\n\nQ: Can you add support for \"x\" wood type?\n> A: Go try the mod\n\nQ: A block type isnt supported, can I add it myself?\n> A: Not directly as registration cant be conditional and cant depend on config files. If you are a modder and know code you can make a pull request to the mod or use the EveryCompatAPI class directly in your mods (check their javadocs & mod modules for info)\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Me‚ù§Ô∏è\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

To prevent a few game mechanics from breaking, animals now automatically gain <strong>Persistence</strong> when ridden by the player, named with a name tag, bred or born as a result of breeding, and when tamed by the player. All mobs can additionally become persistent when spawned from a spawn egg or the <code>/summon</code> command, although this specific behavior is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In case the changes to animal spawning mechanics break the behavior of another mod, a <strong>Blacklist</strong> for individual animals can be found in the config file.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2I6rTiy.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"16\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>‚úèÔ∏è Notes:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The behavior of Respawnable Animals is controllable on a per world basis via the use of a custom <code>persistentAnimals</code> game rule.

Enabling Respawnable Animals retroactively simply requires updating said game rule by executing <code>/gamerule persistentAnimals false</code>. In a survival world with cheats disabled the command can be run by temporarily hosting a lan session from the pause menu with cheats enabled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Respawnable Animals runs purely on the <strong>server-side</strong>. It even works when using a vanilla client to connect to a Forge server having this mod installed.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2I6rTiy.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"16\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üèÜ Credits:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Developing Respawnable Animals was helped and inspired by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/b3spectacled\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>B3spectacled</strong></span></a> for inspiring the idea behind this project with their <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-spawns\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Custom Spawns</span></a> mod</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2I6rTiy.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"16\" /></p>","published":"2023-05-10T21:03:38.643378Z","updated":"2023-08-17T07:13:47.857010Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":11460,"followers":40,"categories":["game-mechanics","mobs"],"additional_categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["D5HGfNc5","7EyIARHa","XBlB9nCp","I70BGD6W","swSQRnaV","UCWI8RxQ","BSNLebvS","v7ycbZ7O","OXBRf5bv","RvpMjRub","NU6xkngP","Rtle0vOI","rfTx5X1Z","c4kGVgt5","R65fOJX8","irtVKuXe"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WnwcSeWc/e662181edcad933421cc3c658d5405d31a778401.png"},"version":{"id":"R65fOJX8","project_id":"WnwcSeWc","author_id":"rHdGpxOA","featured":false,"name":"[FORGE] [1.20.1] RespawningAnimals-v8.1.1","version_number":"v8.1.1-1.20.1-Forge","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v8.1.1-1.20.1] - 2023-08-17\n### Changed\n- Made it a lot less likely for Respawning Animals to be responsible for endless animal over-spawning in case of a mod conflict\n\n## [v8.1.0-1.20.1] - 2023-08-15\n- Completely rewrote the mod to no longer rely on animals being classified as instances of the `Animal` class internally, instead now any mob with the `CREATURE` mob category will be affected fully\n- This should mainly solve issues with modded animals being allowed to constantly spawn in the world without ever being forced to despawn\n- Also, internally no more mixins are used, all the behavior is achieved using built-in events, hopefully aiding mod compatibility (Forge only)\n### Removed\n- Removed the config file, the animal mob spawn cap is now controlled via a new `animalMobCap` game rule, the animal blacklist was migrated to a new `respawninganimals:persistent_animals` entity type tag\n\n## [v8.0.0-1.20.1] - 2023-06-27\n- Ported to Minecraft 1.20.1\n\n[Keep a Changelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-17T07:13:41.187291Z","downloads":1030,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8df5aa99e3c30eedb3bb00ae2011884b443f2857","sha512":"6bb63aac8a7cd1706ed8c15bfb218d7db2b22f57e37d36e891a733cbb3207493855cb46beeed0edb6562bc2a80cc3be468e03b43a9313699ab1a8195d9dec906"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WnwcSeWc/versions/R65fOJX8/RespawningAnimals-v8.1.1-1.20.1-Forge.jar","filename":"RespawningAnimals-v8.1.1-1.20.1-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":62621,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"QAGBst4M","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"16LTXWDj","user":{"id":"GpOHZG9G","username":"LunaPixelStudios","name":"Luna Pixel Studios","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135580893?v=4","bio":"https://discord.gg/LunaPixel","created":"2023-06-05T06:00:30.865746Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Studio","ordering":0},{"team_id":"16LTXWDj","user":{"id":"rHdGpxOA","username":"Fuzs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28218241?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-28T20:59:56.133727Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"RespawningAnimals-v8.1.1-1.20.1-Forge.jar"},"mods\\jei-1.20.1-forge-15.2.0.27.jar":{"sha512":"9e94d5d909f37bdc06d18873c5df34daec4ab74a5cb3814fe23d63fe8398b0585d997677905e0a6caf993f3239543049f75d8f911f4159fff416ff84331d480a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"u6dRKJwZ","slug":"jei","project_type":"mod","team":"H2zAm1Kt","title":"Just Enough Items","description":"JEI -

An old, no longer maintained mod from the days of 1.12.2.\n  \n  Old versions of Minecraft used a system called the Ore Dictionary. Its purpose was to make the life of modders easier when adding new resources that might exist in other mods already. When used correctly, you could use resources from various mods in their recipes interchangeably. However, if you ever played a big modpack back in the days, you probably know that there were like 10 different ingots for each material because of many mods adding them.\n  \n  This often resulted in a lack of storage space because all these resources from the different mods didn't stack. Additionally, some mods didn't use the dictionary correctly for their recipes so a lot of the resources were useless.\n  \n  UniDict solved this issue by unifying the same resources from different mods so only one item for each resource was left and could be used for all recipes. So instead of having 10 different copper ingots, you will only have one which acts as the dominant universal copper ingot.\n  \n  A lot of time has passed since 1.12.2 and the Ore Dictionary is long gone. In today's modded Minecraft, there is the tag system which acts quite similar to the Ore Dictionary. Still, they also don't solve the problem of many similar resources from different mods.\n  \n  **Almost Unified** tries to solve this by working in a similar fashion as UniDict did.<br>\n  Its goal is to have one dominant resource for each configured tag and make all recipes use this dominant entry.\n  \n  ## How does that work?\n  \n  By defining a priority mod list and target tags in the config, Almost Unified tries to find a dominant item for each entry and changes the recipes depending on that.\n  \n  In modern Minecraft, recipes are usually made of JSONs and are loaded when joining a world. Each loaded recipe is read by the mod and altered depending on different properties inside the JSON.\n  \n  For all inputs, the unification process tries to use the designated tag so all items will remain useful which means Almost Unified should also work in existing worlds.<br>\n  For outputs, Almost Unified will use the dominant item.\n  \n  Since the modification happens before the recipe is loaded by the game, there are no demanding processes going on while the game is running.\n  \n  ## What features does Almost Unified have?\n  \n  The mod transforms existing recipes to have a unified resource list that players and packmakers can work with. It doesn't add its own recipes, resources, ore generation or similar content.\n  \n  Because there is a chance to have duplicate recipes when unifying, Almost Unified will take care of duplications and remove them.<br>\n  Additionally, it hides all non-dominant entries from JEI/REI automatically.\n  \n  The mod is fully reloadable. Configs are loaded every time the unification process starts which means they can be edited on the fly. To restart the process, just rejoin the world or use the `/reload` command.\n  \n  ## Can you give an example?\n  \n  Think about having two mods (modA and modB) that both add Silver Ore. Additionally, they both add Silver Ingots and respective recipes to obtain the ingot such as blasting or smelting the ore.\n  \n  If one of those recipes doesn't accept a tag as input, Almost Unify will change that. Furthermore, it will pick one of the Silver Ingots as the dominant item depending on the mod priority list inside the `unify.json` config. The dominant Silver Ingot will then be used as output for all recipes no matter the mod.\n  \n  After the unification process, you will end up with some equal recipes. Almost Unified will merge them and change their namespace so it's visible that the recipe was changed. In the end, you will have recipes that accept tags as inputs and only the dominant item as output. Duplicate recipes are gone.\n  \n  ## More Information\n  \n  For more information like limitations, native integrations or the FAQ, check out the wiki.\n\n</details>","published":"2022-08-21T11:19:19.594924Z","updated":"2023-11-21T13:58:46.735753Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":42645,"followers":130,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["5i3CDEPU","iPLl09Yp","HhEJwJjY","g6596Yhc","pxqDqMR6","IVGC6GrB","jzr8fnoX","6EEkziWr","adgBCDRT","nztD7CVi","dawIr2ll","1sPatF7i","XGrgybng","ZwTnMmsN","AqanTMTr","HPuyitzl","oq3dWrDm","fNkrtiCX","pWEJ9lt3","WD9vKXPX","v6TWHsCN","bFsMCCI6","F8ZrO9vc","NpapGvte","jqeqVVU7","diMbNXT8","7LOb0z3O","PNIkXs2V","PZ1V7Mci","NO4DBmZX","iWb6tbB4","kpra2XLr","SgSIjplb","Pe0tpYJe","sGZHzc7i","JSklQ9zu","bhmQdcdc","NvAPdMNm","YWoIpT1N","1UTu2EZZ","bpU76t3g","nbWcrGAi","lPrtVfBj","ya2hRYzy","YrBC9X9Q","X9usGUNQ","HfZeAiCX","qYNUAgzM","9iqXwRfp","ZkyaGWIx","ILB4Tm76","tYSS6Dib","VbNDGDII","vtOvInZA","Q9mxb7xs","cqbprPRc","Ocp2iq9E","xsvYCII8","9KNjI95c","XVbUWwC0","3xmHIA1J","S0wK1InC","OzxnzRxV","hXKgUk4D","hopcp0yt","WAGfVZjm","IkNQoRt2","80DhYnOt","LdpXU2mS","T3CnKiSU","Yyn03ljA","v6YSY0pw","Q1gWMYfR","hLr3jBxm","nrvWF22W","gUWPql3A","j1Ol0QER","NE5NsB65","vTWwDNWJ","x5KiRGNC","okZK8Lx5","NBNpbYAb","MkAI529t","ojpdph1V","lasgBuqp","KVOLhJSI","YDzvW95p","RiyZchYc","BesPYHZb","V7hJewmj","OplTfJDp","Uz6NJPcS","Cv3LWEEJ","ZT0u2HWk","ssbygc7n","fsSMrcgk","x8bJybK2","rMGSeDQz","wf3YSwoi","FAyhbLco","cwqdMHhD","hZvVvT8l","ZgDGxFc0","CSpPvatX","nLhRL3pq","sLS6oELk","W9q8bqP2","EGTJES1W","uqCiAPR4","ArjVJrdK","BAOk2AD7","1ov14RO9","tz9oQbzV","75K9jgbe","SiYTfq3f","jwZMFRqk","SYjdtQf1","vf8VT8aD","UvrZ6tFP","qVQ9f5D3","RjuumRfU","cSA0vt27","wzoXsAbJ","VUCF7R3A","IVNh2VAz","psiEddgv","mkiJRdLr","5THCGs2c","AzVUB6Vw","pcjL4aza","B9kFoHlt","7FxN2bNC","ncgNC12H","JQ3UqpzN","BnnMpdMG","MJwm2tmA","pqru65nb","brlyx43J","iPxDcTPR","k5BCFqKK","JZngR05p","iSU1L7cZ","8qeBGZYn","nFn0L5rw","cW3D2dSO","BiQhqfNX","8ALuKRsp","COPYJEcR","pchFVUfS","Vqb7bNrf","TbGxfXN7","vhMO7SQr","ETalPdiu","GPhV5diy","2bCWZOhd","iL1uzqLm","hrMz1WTy","YH1x7MeQ","HEFHUYYd","N5V4FGet","1S0kr114","EJj6qcep","MzOf4RYa","LKHPEmI5","eaBbozYP","IoeasYuS","PJdf652f","Jb8q6qK2","Kx0VExGM","MoAvkrMK","r3Jd2eXo","WpnR2Tvd","p33YZ9DO","ybQ1TnE4","UmPU7AO8","Ci0KgTme"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sdaSaQEz/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ybQ1TnE4","project_id":"sdaSaQEz","author_id":"qtbuSRQ6","featured":true,"name":"AlmostUnified-Forge-1.20.1-0.7.2","version_number":"1.20.1-0.7.2+forge","changelog":"\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-21T13:27:20.051828Z","downloads":2994,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d76323c10136860357adfd19ca8f680728fd1178857f225d412e006d3323686181e3ece014f1d308bf15485888efadb9d397c4bb07090872aed9c9d23f3bc76e","sha1":"aabaac05af4d34222b662ea168fa013208ad4a90"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sdaSaQEz/versions/ybQ1TnE4/almostunified-forge-1.20.1-0.7.2.jar","filename":"almostunified-forge-1.20.1-0.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":203811,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"u6dRKJwZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"almostunified-forge-1.20.1-0.7.2.jar"},"mods\\Highlighter-1.20.1-forge-1.1.9.jar":{"sha512":"a8b9e114281c1390ecded38a6114516dc0b3ae0e4cb0f041162d54b6cabfacf077c7394075c43c1565a01362cdbf37e45c3bdeac2aa5b8dede93970bafd44c65","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"cVNW5lr6","slug":"item-highlighter","project_type":"mod","team":"DbFpDzeZ","title":"Item Highlighter","description":"Highlights newly picked-up items.

need it to connect to servers that have it. It also works in singleplayer.\n\n</center>\n\n## Leaves Us in Peace\n\nThis mod aims to make leaf decay less frustrating.\n\nIt started out as a fork of [Tfarcenim's](https://github.com/Tfarcenim) [LeafMeAlone](https://github.com/Tfarcenim/LeafMeAlone), but then I overhauled it to the point of it being an almost entirely different mod.\n\nIt does 3 (+1) things to change how leaves decay, all configurable:\n1) Leaves will ignore leaves of a different type when determining whether to decay or not. By default, this will only \n   match identical leaves (like in LeafMeAlone), but if a tag for leaves is found, all leaves in that tag will match. \n   This is how the mod handles azaleas' two types of leaves. Mods (or mod users) can add compat for trees with multiple \n   types of leaves by just adding a tag. Details on [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/supersaiyansubtlety/leaves_us_in_peace/-/wikis/home).\n2) Leaves will ignore logs from different tree types when determining whether to decay or not. This will look for a tag \n   by the name of the log and check if it contains the leaves doing the check. If no tag is found, any log will match \n   instead (like in vanilla). Details on [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/supersaiyansubtlety/leaves_us_in_peace/-/wikis/home).\n3) Leaves will decay much faster. This is basically like the fast leaf decay mods you've likely seen before. It's \n   highly configurable, and uses an algorithm that can check for diagonal leaves, in addition to the usual check for \n   adjacent leaves, so it's less likely to leave a stray leaf or two floating.\n- 3 + 1. This isn't convenient or less frustrating, but leaves can optionally make a block breaking sound and create \n   particles when they decay. \n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Configuration</summary>\n\nConfiguration requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files), \nand configuring the mod in-game requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions).\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Match leaves types (default: true): Leaves ignore leaves of other types when determining whether to decay or not\n- Match logs to leaves (default: true): Leaves ignore logs of other tree types when determining whether to decay or not\n- Ignore persistent leaves (default: true): Leaves ignore persistent leaves (placed by player) when determining whether to decay or not\n- Accelerate leaves decay (default: true): Make leaves decay much faster\n- Decay delay: Random delay between leaves decaying and updating nearby leaves. Has no effect if 'Accelerate leaves decay' is 'No'.\n  - Minimum (default: 10): Minimum random delay.

These banner patterns are crafted using a pottery sherd and paper together in a crafting table. The wandering traders may occasionally trade a pattern with you as well. These new patterns work exactly the same as vanilla patterns, simply put them in the loom with a banner and some dye.</p>\n\n<h2>FaQ</h2>\n<p><strong>How can I use the mod on older Minecraft versions that don't have pottery sherds?</strong><br>While pottery sherds are not available on older versions of the game I still wanted to make the patterns available for players who may not be able to update. On these older versions you can obtain the patterns by trading with the wandering trader.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I configure the wandering trader trades?</strong><br>Yes, using the archaeologybanners.json file in your config folder you can configure the new trades added by the mod. The config will allow you to disable specific trades or change their cost and other related properties. You will need to restart the game for these changes to take effect. You need to run the game with the mod installed at least once for the config file to be generated.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I apply multicolour patterns?</strong><br>Certain patterns like the sniffer pattern will present you with multiple options in the loom. Each option is a different part of the base texture which you can colour individually. For example you can colour the body, shell, and nose of the sniffer different colours. Each subvariant is treated as an independent and optional layer to the pattern. Every pattern also includes a default single colour pattern which will be the first pattern displayed in the loom.</p>\n\n<h2>Credits &amp; Contact</h2>\n<p>Like the mod and want to support me?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Installing it on a server won't do anything.**\n\nThis mod allows you to type some emoji/symbols more easily in Minecraft. To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones _already in the game_ easier. For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc) if you uninstall the mod. I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that.\n\n### Typing Emojis\nTo type an emoji in chat, simply type a \":\" (colon), after that a list of all possible emoji keywords will appear. Once you type a keyword it will be replaced with the corresponding emoji or symbol. If you want to type an emoji outside of chat (anvil, sign, etc) the list won't appear but the keywords all still work.\n\n### Gallery\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type/gallery\">**Images of example mod usage**</a>\n\n### 2.0.0 Update\n- The mod is now fully configurable through Mod Menu and Cloth Config.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ‚ö° Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ‚ö° Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":422208,"followers":709,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"4FXHDE9F","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.53 (Forge 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n##\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n<br>\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n##\n\n### Placeholders\n<br>\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n##\n\n### Config\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n\n```toml\n# Lets you enable /

All code is open source and documented.\n\nüé≠ Summary\n----------\n\nThe Conjurer is a magician inspired Illager miniboss. He owns a theater deep in the roofed forest biome. He has plenty of tricks up his sleve, so don‚Äôt take him lightly!\n\nüé¨ Video Showcases\n------------------\n\nHere are some awesome showcases & videos about The Conjurer, created by us and the community.

Each room in the theater has multiple variants, which are picked from randomly. The audience in the theater can be made up of Pillagers, Vindicators, the occasional Witch, and if you‚Äôre lucky, an Illusioner might come to watch.\n\n![theater](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/332191302903939325-06-23-2022-1655999104.png)\n\nüé© Conjurer Hat\n---------------\n\nOnce you have stolen the show, or defeated him, The Conjurer drops his hat, a piece of fashion that will keep the Bad Omens away. The band on the hat is dyable similar to leather armor. He also drops 2-4 emeralds each time.\n\n![Hats](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/643654402754468438-357487446441813485-06-06-2020-1591502033.png)\n\n---\n\nüåê Translate The Conjurer - help break the language barrier!\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll translators are credited here that have translated the mod to their native languages.

These options are _not_ intended to be crash-proof.\n\nOverrides also work for entities and items, via `[entityProviderOverrides]` and `[itemProviderOverrides]` respectively.\n\nIf too many inappropriate blocks are being matched, you may want to disable the default matching logic for a provider entirely:\n\n```\n[registryProviderDefaults]\n\t\"inventory_tabs:block_simple\" = false\n```\n\nThe `block_simple` provider uses a blacklist instead of a whitelist, so it generates a lot of false-positive tabs. It's enabled by default to help with finding good/bad tabs - but if you're making a modpack, you'll probably turn it off!\n\n---\n\n### Mod Architecture\n\nEach visible tab on the screen is a [Tab](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/tabs/Tab.java), which is responsible for rendering itself, knowing how to be opened, and knowing when it should be removed from the list of tabs (e.g. when no longer in range).\n\nThese tabs are held by the [Tab Manager](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/TabManager.java), which is effectively the \"Tab Screen\". It adds onto regular screen methods to do its own rendering, ticking, and mouse click handling. It's also responsible for checking if any new tabs should be added.\n\nTabs are added via registered [Tab Providers](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/TabProviders.java). Basic providers like [Vehicle Inventory](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/VehicleInventoryTabProvider.java) check simple conditions and add a special tab. The more advanced [Registry Providers](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/RegistryTabProvider.java) are designed to be assigned a specific set of [blocks](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/BlockTabProvider.java), [entity types](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/EntityTabProvider.java), or [items](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/ItemTabProvider.java) that they're responsible for providing tabs for - which is frozen at reload time - and then searching for those around the player every tick. Using these generics, simpler concrete providers are made ([Ender Chests](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/EnderChestTabProvider.java), [Unique Block](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/blob/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/inventory_tabs/providers/UniqueBlockTabProvider.java).)\n\n\n### Addons\n\n```\nrepositories {\n\tmaven { url \"https://repo.sleeping.town/\" }\n}\ndependencies {\n   modImplementation \"folk.sisby:inventory-tabs:1.1.1\"\n}\n```\n\nAddons for Inventory Tabs 4 can add new tab types and tab providers, and add advanced matching logic to current providers, provide custom tab layouts for their screens (including inverted tabs), and signal when specific tabs should be marked as open.\n\nFor a practical example, check out [Portable Crafting](https://github.com/sisby-folk/portable-crafting)!\n\n---\n\n### Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others - We're the fourth set of maintainers of this mod!<br/>\nThis version is a partial rewrite, following the work of CakeWhip, LiamMCW, and Andrew6rant.\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n","published":"2023-12-04T11:08:57.791919Z","updated":"2024-01-16T01:31:25.475710Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4300,"followers":102,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","utility"],"additional_categories":["library","management"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["LcshnMwE","DsMb3X8H","aDRikxnK","68PPKAuE","DL55TMoN","dMlIhju0","Gm8Za1ix","QWO4kQpa","BHjpJKFE","OljO6xv5","BoDn1g2j","IB2MSLxC","zbzyLLB4","JVwFmQtt","8ddRWSQt","YIZD0Zqs","4sCV2PSx","Y1iN5TCT","CqW13Nzb","qOLtroYR","6e7jeLyW","JfFhyoOh","46TT5BXo","K0zEVjqd","POEO81R1","R4apwnTx","hhBUJ1Cz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VD1aynYU/e40145fd1e52dfbe3a4a852773f0ee088b6c9b83.png"},"version":{"id":"hhBUJ1Cz","project_id":"VD1aynYU","author_id":"HrZk20E5","featured":false,"name":"1.1.5","version_number":"1.1.5+1.20","changelog":"Changes:\n* Fix multiblock tab not being active if wrong half is opened by [@ellie-semele](https://github.com/ellie-semele) in [#21](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/pull/21)\n* Fix IDs with `.` in their path breaking config - as fixed upstream in quilt config ([#25](https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/issues/25))\n\n\nChangelog: https://github.com/sisby-folk/inventory-tabs/releases/tag/v1.1.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-16T01:31:26.403421Z","downloads":986,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f471b9f79c0873b63b5817e6932cd626d6c5ca65","sha512":"14db3bb9ba80ddd36d93e9a32d14bc18d47a1af90866f439bbeb2f9140f031eceb09e3c53f61ab0fa518b9a60abb5a50e1bed2b30c794a4a5639cf42afa764fd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VD1aynYU/versions/hhBUJ1Cz/inventory-tabs-1.1.5%2B1.20.jar","filename":"inventory-tabs-1.1.5+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":343215,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2mZhxGiT","user":{"id":"HrZk20E5","username":"sisby-folk","name":"Nora H","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HrZk20E5/icon.png","bio":"A handful of technicolor monsters.\n\nFound on discord through unascribed's guild and prism.\n\nhttps://tech.lgbt/@sleepingdragoninn","created":"2021-04-17T05:28:15.123494Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"inventory-tabs-1.1.5+1.20.jar"},"mods\\explosive-enhancement-1.2.1-1.20.x.jar":{"sha512":"c20ca6b0b01fc4aa5d673713c50ae83286c8159fd4adcae327d322745d3175ca6f9aa57fcc269b0c125d0b9b7047ec3df06bdbde3bf01bcdf53328d36ee9915a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OSQ8mw2r","slug":"explosive-enhancement","project_type":"mod","team":"RCkqJVDY","title":"Explosive Enhancement","description":"Makes the explosion animation look cooler.","body":"# Explosive Enhancement\n\n### Enhancing explosions since 2023.\n\nExplosive Enhancement is a simple mod that makes explosions look better.

you modify vanilla player names to anything you want (ex. without the triangle brackets!)\n- Minimizes spam with a counter that shows how many duplicate messages have been sent in a row\n- Shifts the chat hud up by 10 pixels, so it doesn't overlap with the armor bar\n- Provides a menu to copy specific data (and the text of course!) from chat messages\n- Lets you search through all received messages with a search bar\n- All of this is configurable, with much more to offer!\n\nThis mod also provides features from a multitude of other mods, including:\n- [More Chat

but I don't provide official support for it.\n- Will you make it for (older Minecraft version)?¬†\n  - Not likely. The oldest version I'll be making is 1.18.x. Any older version would only be supported if it is generally recognized as a modding-LTS version and if it is commonly requested, because backporting is boring and makes me want to die.\n- Will you make this for Forge?¬†\n  - Probably at some point after all the major changes I want to implement are finished. But right now, I doubt it. Fabric's API is simple, and I am too lazy to learn Forge's until then.\n- I found a bug/issue, what do I do?\n  - First, make sure you have the latest version of the mod for your Minecraft version. If it still persists,¬†you can click on the Issues tab on this page, and nobody has opened one about your issue then create one! Note that a lack of provided information will increase time needed to fix.\n- It says I need to install Fabric, but I already have it installed?\n  - [Install the Fabric API.](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n- Do servers need this mod?¬†\n  - It is client side, so no.\n- I can't access the config menu in-game!\n  - <u>For 1.19.2+:</u> After ensuring YACL and Mod Menu are installed, if you still cannot access the config, check for an error message and [open an\n    issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/issues/new/choose). If there isn't an error message, [open an issue anyway](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/issues/new/choose) and follow the instructions in the issue template.\n  - <u>For 1.18.x:</u> You need the LATEST versions of both [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/versions?l=fabric&c=release) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions?l=fabric&c=release) to access it in game.\n  - <u>For all versions:</u> You can always edit the config at `(directory)/config/chatpatches.json`.\n- My config is broken/not working!\n  - When you load one of the more recent mod versions, it makes a creates a new file with your old settings and resets the main file. You can access this\n    copy at `(directory)/config/chatpatches_old.json`.

This irritates the cells in human eyes through a short series of acidic chemical reactions, producing an iconic reaction.\n\nThis mod adds the ability to cut onions into slices (rings) to achieve a similar effect! The varying impacts of chopping onions are detailed further in the config.\n\n### Advancements\n- **Cry Me a River:** Make a Ghast shed a tear by cutting onions nearby.\n- **Ninjas Cutting Onions Again...:** While invisible, bring at least ten creatures to tears by cutting onions.\n\n## Config\n\nYou can alter the following:\n- Does cutting onions have any impact at all? (default: **true**)\n  - (Note: setting this to false basically turns this into a mod that just adds two or three foods.)\n- Does peeling Big Onion blocks from [Overweight Farming](https://modrinth.com/mod/overweight-farming) with an axe have the same effect as cutting onions? (default: **true**)\n- Block radius within which blocks/entities are affected\n  - Default: **2**. Must be an integer. Capped at 16 to prevent extreme performance impacts.\n- Does cutting onions cause damage to entities at all? (default: **true**)\n- Chance of making ghasts shed a tear. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.5**)\n- Chance of converting obsidian into crying obsidian. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.25**)\n- Chance of growing nearby weeping vines. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.75**)\n\n### Tags\nThis mod adds two primary tags:\n- `onion_onion:unaffected_by_onions`: an entity type tag populated with mobs that do not react to onions being cut in their vicinity. Includes skeletons, bosses, and a couple other creatures by default.\n- `onion_onion:onion_proof_helmets`: entities wearing items from this tag on their head do not take onion-related damage. Includes items that cover the eyes, such as the diving helmets from [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create).\n\n- There's also a minor item tag for `motley_mushrooms` to include mushroom items that belong in the motley grill recipe. By default it includes compat with [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery).\n---\n\n**Requires [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) and [Blueprint](https://modrinth.com/mod/blueprint).**\n\nNote: this mod is *not* affiliated with vectorwing. Any questions regarding this mod should be directed to my [issue tracker](https://github.com/davidjjung/oniononion/issues), not his. Feel free to direct any suggestions (compat or otherwise) towards the tracker as well.

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## üìñAbout üìñ\n</center>\n\nJust Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED) is a JEI plugin that provides useful information regarding status effects.\n\nThe mod adds a new Effects recipe category accessed either by clicking any of the newly added status effect icons on the JEI item screen or by clicking an active effect from its box on the inventory screen.\n\nHere you'll be able to view information regarding such status effect such as items that can provide it or its description as well as which mod it's from or its effect color.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8qv5ZN.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UfGgoGG.png)\n\n<center>\n\n## üß™ Customization üß™\n</center>\n\nThe mod automatically adds all registered status effect to its page, however modded effects won't had a description.\n\nModders can easily add such descriptions to their effect by adding the string `\"effect.[mod_id].[effect_name].description\"` to their language file.\n\nSince the mod can only automatically detect food items as effect providing ones, mod developers can also easily add support to their custom effect or effect providing items by adding some recipes into their mod.\n\nTo do so one can simply use one of the two newly added recipes categories:\n- \"jeed:effect_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can provide an effect in the following format:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:effect_provider\",\n  \"effect\":{\n    \"id\": \"minecraft:haste\"\n  },\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:beacon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- \"jeed:potion_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can contain any registered potion like tipped arrows for example:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:potion_provider\",\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:splash_potion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:tipped_arrow\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you would like to

Make sure to test your results to see if you require it.\n\n## About\n\nSimplified AI modification mod focused on performance and low-level modifications to AIs in the game. Picking up the slack for the base game and improving it for a modded ecosystem. Handling common problems such as too many animals, performance hits from swarms of zombies, and simple remove tasks skipped by larger AI improvement mods.\n\n## Story\n\nAI Improvements was born out of the need to improve server performance for large heavily modded servers. As any experienced server owner will know a server's CPU clock time is eaten away by mods all trying to fight over resources. Most server owners and developers will try to attack this problem by trimming mods. Rather than going after the¬†mods installed¬†I started to look at Minecraft itself. Focusing down on how it was designed to work and how it lent to performance problems.\n\nI found that as a server's population grows so does the amount of¬†entities and other resources. At first, I thought \"lets reduce the spawn rate of mobs on the server\" this lead to a complaint about mob farming. Even with testing, it didn't show a major solution to the problem. So rather than taking that approach, I decided to improve how the AI's function. This resulted in a lot of resource and insight into different areas. After many hours, I found my solution and created this mod.¬†\n\n## FAQ¬†\n\n<ins>I installed but didn't see a large gain as promised?</ins>\\\nNewer versions of MC implement fixes for the AI. With the last few versions, the rotation fix was implemented in addition to other fixes. Thus, the impact of this mod is much lower than in older versions.\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the server only?</ins>\\\nYes, the mod is coded to function without it being client side\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the client only?</ins>\\\nYes, though it may not¬†do much to improve fps.¬†\n\n<ins>Where is the config?</ins>\\\n`.minecraft/config/bbm/AI_Improvements.cfg`\n\n<ins>What will happen if I¬†disable the EntityLookHelper replacement?</ins>\\\nYou're not going to see much of an improvement in the AI code. However, if you enabled the other disable configs it should be fine.\n\n<ins>How does this mod work for fixing performance?</ins>\\\nIt depends on the feature and version of Minecraft. Most of the performance comes from caching heavily calculated values. This has the result of reducing CPU time at the cost of an ignorable amount of RAM. See feature list for exacts...\n\n## Current Features:\n\n### Config to disable AI Watch Closest Entity\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. When changed¬†to true¬†it will remove an AI segment called EntityAIWatchClosest. This AI segment handles the coded AIs use to rotate their head towards a nearby entity.Visually this will cause a few odd issues. However, for the CPU this frees up a lot of usage caused by entities.¬†\n\n### Config to disable AI look random, config is not enabled by default\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. Setting the config to true will cause entities¬†to no longer use the 'look idle'¬†AI code. This can improve performance for servers will large populations. As almost every entity on the map will use this when not doing anything important. Visually this can cause the entities head to not rotate sometimes but mostly goes unnoticed.\n\n### Config to replace EntityLookHelper with a more efficient version, config is enabled by default\n\nThis is the main feature of the mod and can greatly improve CPU performance at a small cost to RAM. How this works is MC's look helper code is replaced with a custom version. The custom version stores some data that makes it faster to get the angle for a location. Threw some testing with VisualVM result have shown a 50% to 80% decrease in CPU usage by the AI code. For a server with 25 people on constantly this resulted in a gain from¬†5 to¬†7 tps.¬†","published":"2023-04-16T18:51:48.421272Z","updated":"2023-11-20T12:57:53.791109Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":56242,"followers":67,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["tSHaOkjT","eJihmpNQ","WfWIqNar","FXloZ58B"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DSVgwcji/819dbaeb9b0dac8250a1403d1db7e7646f9a9b8f.png"},"version":{"id":"eJihmpNQ","project_id":"DSVgwcji","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-0.5.2","version_number":"0.5.2","changelog":"- Update to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T14:33:24.693482Z","downloads":43432,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"eb932308aceb30f5157e967f1bd4b57eb1a1b2093886cbfaef6524b780337b8b0e2bd41c5103694c3a275827ceb7d63e7c55637a7a46f8e21f0a6770346b757d","sha1":"11ad483d1fd1f7ebd84b4940b1dc0926b3e9daa8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DSVgwcji/versions/eJihmpNQ/AI-Improvements-1.20-0.5.2.jar","filename":"AI-Improvements-1.20-0.5.2.jar","primary":true,"size":29553,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"mICmB3NF","user":{"id":"j2vvv1qU","username":"bl4ckscor3","name":"bl4ckscor3","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/j2vvv1qU/a33ac86ccb684d2fb402233151412018699f1c3c.png","bio":"","created":"2021-06-27T09:17:06.110534Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"mICmB3NF","user":{"id":"13eYRC13","username":"DarkGuardsman","name":"Robin Seifert","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1477330?v=4","bio":"Full Stack java developer(2018) \r\n|| BS in Computer Science(2018)\r\n|| Hobby game developer and game modification developer since 2010","created":"2022-12-07T15:15:42.331609Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"AI-Improvements-1.20-0.5.2.jar"},"mods\\nerb-1.20.1-0.3-FORGE.jar":{"sha512":"be46225ec0a8636799605b1369c60bd6f150c428982d3b7f0d0b2ca114aa7f1a77658c6763f1d678d184d02213c6cb617c20607b8f445e47c4d947838db89d9c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"bQh7xzFq","slug":"nerb","project_type":"mod","team":"20Vhjk7o","title":"Not Enough Recipe Book [NERB]","description":"Completely removes recipe book from the game, optimizing player data.","body":"This mod was created for only one simple purpose - completely remove recipe book from the game.

upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, brand new **tools and weapons** to hunt and gather with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the Advancements!** They explain many of the basic concepts, and are a good place to start from.\n\nPick up any item, then press the **L** key (by default) to open the Advancements screen. Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":193826,"followers":483,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"AxgOboGq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen.

Expect all kinds of critters from small to big now roaming your Minecraft world\n¬†\n## Mod-loader, Version and Config\n\nThis mod is being developed for Fabric and Forge. No backports are planned.\n\nTo modify which animals you can find in your world you can just use a data-pack to edit the respective biome tags that they use to spawn.\n\n# Content\n\n![tab](https://imgur.com/kDd5Q7r.png)\n\n### To take a closer look at the features, go to the images section or even look at the wiki!\n**Currently the wiki is wip, but will be updated soon**\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Angler Fish** : \n\nAngler fish spawn in all Deep Oceans, they have unique pathfinding and will always prefer staying near the bottom of bodies of water, making them often found near the ocean depths.\n\n-Angler fish have an emissive layer and custom particles\n\n-Angler fish can be bucketed\n\n-Angler fish cannot withstand the pressure of being on land and will promptly deflate when exposed to air\n\n-When an Angler fish is fed shiny items it will grant the player with `5 minutes of night vision` (these items are contained in a special tag, so they can be edited easily in mod-packs\n\n-Angler fish drop themselves as an item and can be eaten for `5 seconds of night vision`\n\n\n- **Tuna** : \n\nTunas can be found swimming around in Cold Oceans and regular Oceans, both deep and normal. They are the first farmable fish and come with food items and new breeding mechanics.\n\n-Tunas can be bred with fish from a custom tag, once bred they will lay a `Tuna Egg`, a new Armor Stand like entity that will hatch into a baby Tuna\n\n-Tunas are too big to be bucketed, but don't worry, you can transport Tuna Eggs easily with a bucket\n\n-Tunas drop multiple `Tuna Chunks` when killed, which can be cooked, eaten, or turned into a `Tuna Sandwich`\n\n\n- **Seahorse** : \n\nSeahorses are found in Warm Oceans and are the only fish capable of turning its head to look at you!\n\n-Seahorses come in `6 different variants` and when bucketed they display their color with a handy tooltip\n\n-Seahorses are actually capable of clicking and growling, just like in real life\n\n\n- **Snail** : \n\nSnails can be found in Taigas and Old Growth Pine/Spruce Taigas and are quite packed with features\n\n-Snails retreat in their shell when taking damage or when a non shifting player is nearby. When in their shell they are immune to melee damage lower than 12 and cannot move\n\n-You can remove a `Snail's Shell` by shooting a projectile at the Snail while it's not inside its home, the shell can regrow with time\n\n-Snail Shells have 4 main uses: they can be used to turn into bone meal, they can be used to craft `Potted Sweet Berries`, a new block that allows you to collect berries with style while also keeping you safe from their thorns, it can be used in conjunction with other ingredients to create `Escargot` and it can be used as a building material to make some fancy new blocks!\n\n-When Snails get wet, they produce a `Mucus` Trail. This can be triggered by making them stand on wet sponges, mud or getting in contact with water (these blocks can be configured), right clicking them with a bucket of water or exposing them to rain\n\n-Mucus slows down all mobs that aren't Snails and it can be collected to then be either cooked into slime or turned into `Mucus Blocks` a handy new redstone block\n\n-Mucus Blocks slow down entities on contact and solidify when next to water, making players able to walk on them. The solidification of mucus spreads through Mucus Blocks in a circular manner\n\n-With Phantom Membrane Mucus Blocks can be turned into `Ghostly Mucus Blocks`, which work the same way, but when not solidified can be walked through just fine and do not slow the player down\n\n-When Snails are bred they both will lay a clutch of eggs to mimic how Snails are hermaphroditic in real life\n\n\n- **Hamster** : \n\nHamsters can be found in Plains and Meadows and more commonly is Sunflower Fields. The Minecraft Sunflower has been replaced with a new one that now rotates with the sun and can be farmed for `Sunflower Seeds`.\n\n-Sunflower Seeds can be roasted to then be eaten fast like dried kelp\n\n-Hamsters spawn with `4 different variants` and randomly look out for danger by standing on their back feet\n\n-Hamsters can be tamed with Sunflower Seeds, once tamed they can be told to sit and follow like other pets\n\n-Hamsters are very territorial and Hamsters tamed to the same player will try to kill each other\n\n-Hamsters actively collect items and put them in their cheek pouches, once their inventory is full their cheeks will get visually larger\n\n-Players can open their Tamed Hamsters' cheek pouch up and use it as portable storage\n\n\n- **Ant** : \n\nAnts are by far the biggest addition, they spawn in Savannas, Plains and biomes in the `#forest` tag packed inside tiny `Anthill` structures \n\n-Ants have a whole biome dedicated to them called `Ant Gardens`, this biome is full of `Fallen Leaves`, Coarse Dirt, Anthills and `Rotten Trees`\n\n-Ants spawn with randomized Speed, Health and Attack and are neutral, they all attack you if you anger one\n\n-Ants work like Bees and can set their home in Anthills. They also collect resources from Dead Bushes and Tall Grass (configurable with a tag) and bring them back to their home.\n\n-Anthills that have the resource level of 3 randomly turn blocks in a 3x3 radius below them into rotten versions of themselves, consuming all 3 of the resource levels. Logs become `Rotten Logs` and Dirt like blocks become `Ant Mounds`. Anthills come in 3 variants: Anthills, Rotten Log Anthills and Ant Farms. \n\n-Rotten Logs have a new unique woodset not strong enough to craft signs and build boats, but able to be mined faster, you can also obtain a new block by clicking `Rotten Planks` with an axe, `Cracked Rotten Planks`, which produce scary creaky noises when walked on\n\n-Ant Mounds are a new brushable block, when destroyed they anger nearby ants and don‚Äôt drop their loot, so make sure to brush it instead! They can be found in `Ant Mounts`, or they can be made by an Anthill, having different loot tables\n\n-Fallen Leaves can be found in Ant Mounds and Ant Gardens and are a new decorative block for your fall themed builds\n\n-`Ant Pupae` can also be found rarely in Ant Mounds, when clicked on the ground they spawn baby `Tamed Ants`\n\n-Tamed Ants work like dogs, they attack any mob you attack and their abdomen can be colored with dyes! Adult Tamed Ants will target other adult Tamed Ants with a different colored abdomen, effectively making you able to set up ant wars\n\n-`Ant Farms` can be crafted with Ant Pupae and are the Beehive alternative to regular Anthills, because they can be collected without silk touch and can be renewably made\n\n-Ant Mounts are a new dungeon structure found in Ant Gardens. They have 4 possible variations and are FULL of Ants and Ant Mounds. The gameplay of the structure consists brushing Ant Mounds and Digging the Packed Mud to get to the other chambers, just be sure not to hit an Ant or break an Ant Mound/Anthill because Ants fight back! This structure has 4 main unique items to find: Ant Pupa, `Crown Pottery Sherd`, `Spade Pottery Sherd` and the `Rot Music Disc`","published":"2023-11-09T23:30:39.563334Z","updated":"2023-11-12T12:05:23.309799Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":35099,"followers":122,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["decoration","food"],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["jGfbbkRl","73LBjQKv","1U2VhIFo","s7b61YnA","RXKJiHaV","Cjjsdx4e"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rex9wwpz/be0be8f4fe41eb5b0aaa2c2885291f36a70aeb9e.png"},"version":{"id":"RXKJiHaV","project_id":"rex9wwpz","author_id":"SRKJvluF","featured":false,"name":"Spawn 1.0.2-forge","version_number":"1.0.2-forge","changelog":"+ Fixed axe stripping issue\n+ Parity Fixes with Fabric","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-11T22:32:49.422961Z","downloads":3344,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4a9ffc09b6bad80bfe21f241bc1f222b4ad7e550","sha512":"624d4d1392e8888d12dc34cc8d4c22e96ad665c4574633877dc1ed6790210a17df12c60ea2f68ffb500cebfc1c419c3c53e12ad9772fd61ce1d23a5c4623bb4a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rex9wwpz/versions/RXKJiHaV/spawn-1.0.2-forge.jar","filename":"spawn-1.0.2-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":7031738,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"QB2dWrFf","user":{"id":"SRKJvluF","username":"Orcinus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/SRKJvluF/6bc2c0d9ba49c8fc01ca93000e8b0696480a55e3.png","bio":"","created":"2021-12-04T03:54:57.699849Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"QB2dWrFf","user":{"id":"Yq8ublDx","username":"bunten","name":"bunten","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Yq8ublDx/d805b85b430281bf8c7aa12a2ded004018b6f519.png","bio":"iam developing\r\n","created":"2020-12-01T23:05:47.969541Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Composer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"QB2dWrFf","user":{"id":"pcavjK69","username":"Ninni","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64173061?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-03T14:55:31.295258Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spawn-1.0.2-forge.jar"},"mods\\Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"12441dcc48f487a5f428dc1799548f46e391bd316358dfab1628ea2020061ee51676dc0f5ebe672980534505734e0cf1a817febf18ed73226b6096b15fb22265","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TaRVOwJr","slug":"etcetera","project_type":"mod","team":"GVZU4hSZ","title":"Etcetera","description":"Simple mod that adds random vanilla friendly features","body":"![logo](https://i.imgur.com/EsmxxXP.png \"Logo\")\n\n\n# About Etcetera\n\nEtcetera is a miscellaneous mod. This means that its features can range from blocks, to items, blocks, storage... et cetera. All these additions are made while keeping Minecraft's gameplay in mind and hopefully fit the game seamlessly.\n\n¬†\n## Mod-loader and Version\n\nThis mod is being developed for Fabric and Forge. No backports are planned.\n\n# Content\n\n![tab](https://i.imgur.com/b2R2Ddr.png)\n\n### To take a closer look at the features, go to the images section or even look at the wiki!\n**Currently both the image section and the wiki is wip, but will be updated soon**\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Bismuth** : \nBismuth is a new ore found in the nether, when mined it gives experience like quartz, but its main focus is decoration and utilities. Bismuth blocks change color slowly over time and Bismuth Ingots can apply this kind of iridescence onto other vanilla blocks. Bismuth is also used to craft a **Chisel**, that can turn blocks into their chiseled form or remove iridescence, a  **Hammer** that can either be used for combat or to crack blocks (both the se items use a .json file format for their \"recipes\" for mod compat) and a  **Wrench**, a survival friendly debug stick that can modify blockstates in a limited fashion\n\n- **Handbell** : The Handbell is new item that is obtained from villagers and can call your pets or following allays to you when ringed if they are not sitting, and give them the glowing effect\n\n- **Drum** : A new noteblock like block that changes sound based on the block below and where the player hits the its top\n\n- **Dice** : A simple and compact redstone randomizer\n\n- **Frame** : A new block that assists builders into making, well, frameworks. It can be placed and replaced later without needing to be broken\n\n- **Prickly Can** : A storage block made with cactus that can delete all the items inside with a click\n\n- **Bouquet** : New items crafted with small flowers, it can only be placed in pots and on vases\n\n- **Vase** : A new block made with rooted dirt, it removes the offset of every block placed on top of it to make for great decoration\n\n- **Item Stand & Glowing Item Stand** :  Like an Item Frame, but in the middle of a block. You can click it with Glass to cover the item for bonus aesthetic points\n\n- **Squid Lamp** : A lamp made with Glow Ink Sacks, can be placed like a torch, glows much brighter underwater\n\n- **Tidal Helmet** :  New armor piece crafted with a Turtle Helmet and a Heart Of the Sea, its a much stronger version of the Turtle Helmet that gives Conduit Power, but also grants more Durability and Strength. This also comes with a new ui element that indicates how much conduit power you have left\n\n- **Turtle Raft** : New boat type entity, it can only old one passenger, but can be dyed like leather armor and can be adorned with banners. Its resistant to water bubble columns and can also fit through one block gaps\n\n- **Crumbling Stone** : A new type of stone that crumbles. When standing, jumping or hitting it with a projectile it starts breaking until you're left with no stone... It can be waxed to use as a decoration though!\n\n- **Leveled Stone** : Used to make Crumbling Stone, mainly used for decoration with it\n\n- **Light Bulb & Tinted Light Bulb** : A new light source that can be right-clicked to change the light value. Tinted Light Bulbs randomly flicker \n\n- **Chapples & Golden Chapples** : Chapples are a new Mooshroom-like Chicken mob, they can be spawned from a Eggple (found in Plains Villages and Pillager Outposts) and they lay Apples instead of Eggs. When a Chapple is struck by lightning or when it's spawned from a Golden Eggple (found in Bastions) it becomes a Golden Chapple, which has only a chance to lay Golden Apples instead of regular Apples\n\n- **Cotton** : Cotton is a new Crop, its seeds are traded by Villagers and found in Plains Villages, it gives Cotton when fully grown, which can be turned into Cotton Clothes, String or Wool\n\n- **Cotton Clothes** : New armor like items that come in 16 colors + Wandering Trader exclusive variant, sometimes have custom models and are slimmer than armor to fit your skin better. They cannot be enchanted and give no armor points, but also have no durability\n\n- **New Tags** :  \n`villager_can_pickup` -> items that can be picked up by Villagers\n`hammerable` & `chisellable` -> Blocks that can be Hammered or Chiseled (these Blocks will play a sound when right-clicked with the respective tool. This does not affect the recipe types of hammers and chisels, but only if they make a sound or not. For example the Anvil is in the Hammerable tag even if it can't be crushed via hamer, but this allows players to be able to hit it making hammering noises for roleplay purposes)\n`non_modifiable` -> Blocks that cannot be modified by a Wrench\n`offset_remover` -> Blocks that remove the XY offset of other Blocks placed on top of them\n`concrete`, `glazed_terracotta`, `sweaters`, `hats` -> item tags that contain all colored versions of their specific item\n`all_concrete`, `all_terracotta`, `all_glazed_terracotta`, `all_wool`, `all_glass_blocks`, `all_glass_panes` -> item tags that contain all colored versions of their specific item + their Bismuth Iridescent variant","published":"2023-07-20T00:05:47.802587Z","updated":"2023-07-24T05:35:02.620755Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":8120,"followers":64,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","management","mobs","storage","technology","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["hBIXWMPO","trBVKD10","OPoTKsQN","Hyth1pEu","OXt4Jd9P","hjOmY3MQ","Nc3JT04L","mUpQm7Ji","42Dm5geR","jLmh1Q4M","uua8xPy8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TaRVOwJr/8525b1bed9e38bf7743c8b789e96f85ec3f0a876.gif"},"version":{"id":"uua8xPy8","project_id":"TaRVOwJr","author_id":"SRKJvluF","featured":false,"name":"Etcetera 1.1.3-forge","version_number":"1.1.3","changelog":"+ Fixed dice block comparator redstone output","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-24T05:35:05.031508Z","downloads":1487,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e622d35948040ed59913cf21b19f109d8a29ec96","sha512":"12441dcc48f487a5f428dc1799548f46e391bd316358dfab1628ea2020061ee51676dc0f5ebe672980534505734e0cf1a817febf18ed73226b6096b15fb22265"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TaRVOwJr/versions/uua8xPy8/Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar","filename":"Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":1720394,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GVZU4hSZ","user":{"id":"SRKJvluF","username":"Orcinus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/SRKJvluF/6bc2c0d9ba49c8fc01ca93000e8b0696480a55e3.png","bio":"","created":"2021-12-04T03:54:57.699849Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor - Code","ordering":0},{"team_id":"GVZU4hSZ","user":{"id":"Yq8ublDx","username":"bunten","name":"bunten","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Yq8ublDx/d805b85b430281bf8c7aa12a2ded004018b6f519.png","bio":"iam developing\r\n","created":"2020-12-01T23:05:47.969541Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor - Sound Design","ordering":0},{"team_id":"GVZU4hSZ","user":{"id":"pcavjK69","username":"Ninni","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64173061?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-03T14:55:31.295258Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Etcetera-1.20.1-1.1.3-Forge.jar"},"mods\\guarding-2.3.3.jar":{"sha512":"bb74342e160a5f9bb2951eee3d84124e60e73bf570b96574eb363b005cf3e850c080f73130f73f3ead945f63ae4dcbff644ef21dc22e534264c6e7c20c95c69b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"aV1COQ7a","slug":"guarding","project_type":"mod","team":"iTOj0tRW","title":"Guarding","description":"A simple mod for Fabric implementing new features to Shields to make them feel more complete.","body":"![GUARDING](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72329798/162586175-66ab50f5-7814-490c-b150-14ec7e567dd3.png)\n\n## üìï About\nGuarding is a small-scale fabric mod that expands upon the Shield, implementing new mechanics and unique enchantments.

related features such as wind particles and hot air balloons!\n\nWind particles display above ground in various Overworld biomes. They appear most frequently in mountainous regions.\n\nHot air balloons can be ridden and flown. Players must use flint and steel and sand to ascend and descend respectively. The player can use shears to remove unwanted sandbags.\n\nAnother unique characteristic of these balloons is that the player cannot control the direction that they float in. Instead, players must use a Gust Gauge in order to monitor the wind direction. Wind blows in a different direction every day. It also blows in a different direction every 32 vertical blocks. This means you are able to change directions at different altitudes.\n\n### Requires GeckoLib\n\n</details>","published":"2023-09-20T02:15:17.919093Z","updated":"2023-10-16T21:13:38.182104Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":2423,"followers":48,"categories":["adventure","transportation"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["c8qRWgaI","5u0PrlLl","Dg8eYgqd","4SjLzXFR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AiTMEFuN/9484555a5cb0796e8ce93382f527f06fd6cb51ad.png"},"version":{"id":"Dg8eYgqd","project_id":"AiTMEFuN","author_id":"CfMhpqoJ","featured":false,"name":"Breezy 1.20.1-1.1.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.1.1","changelog":"- Fixed server startup crash","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-16T21:10:06.720900Z","downloads":1794,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"658fc7c2269ecd2a3a55608ea05e440113946d74","sha512":"7b548dc67d3cefacf8d0762e0c0068256803b7a2e45c3514d72d780792be63473dbcad9a0bf7b20a3903322db5ad1f49e1319c97552bacb48004e9ccb7b4059e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AiTMEFuN/versions/Dg8eYgqd/breezy-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar","filename":"breezy-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar","primary":true,"size":95947,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"ISrpRn5q","project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EXzsEeA5","user":{"id":"CfMhpqoJ","username":"codyhuh","name":"Cody ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46657000?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-13T22:29:19.076649Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"breezy-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar"},"mods\\polymorph-forge-0.49.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"b98103f539b000b1e4e866ff3276aeddfcb1e3198ebe8f0e5d88f24b96cb3f65a335016e8bc03bd41f78b3f6fc6a7f06973dff3bd3e7739f222ad56cde05b9d4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"tagwiZkJ","slug":"polymorph","project_type":"mod","team":"IyMJnv3l","title":"Polymorph","description":"No more recipe conflicts! Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n### Mod Integration\n\n**Note for 1.19.x: Many of these integrations have not been implemented yet on 1.19.x.**\n\n**Just Enough Items**\n\nUpon selecting a recipe to transfer from the Just Enough Item screen, the output will automatically change to match the\nselection if there is more than one possible output.\n\n**Modded Support**\n\nMany crafting tables that are simply variants of the vanilla crafting table will automatically be compatible. Other\ntypes of support may or may not be compatible; below is a list of all mods that Polymorph has specific integration with\nand has already been tested for functionality.\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)\n  - ME Crafting Terminal\n  - ME Pattern Terminal\n- [CraftingCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftingcraft)\n  - Portable Crafting\n  - Inventory Crafting\n- [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Cyclic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic)\n  - Crafter\n  - Workbench\n- [FastFurnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastfurnace)\n  - Furnace\n  - Blasting Furnace\n  - Smoker\n- [FastWorkbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)\n  - Crafting Table\n- [Iron Furnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces)\n  - All furnace variants\n- [Pretty Pipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n- [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage)\n  - Crafting Grid\n  - Pattern Grid\n- [Refined Storage Addons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage-addons)\n  - Wireless Crafting Grid\n- [Simple Storage Network](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-storage-network)\n  - Storage Request Table\n- [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks)\n  - Crafting Upgrade\n  - Smelting Upgrade\n- [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Tom's Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n\nPlease request support by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Polymorph/issues).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2023-12-05T07:44:23.596047Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":290813,"followers":277,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"km82tZAr","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-forge-0.49.2+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.2+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*.

[**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it‚Äôs not the destination that‚Äôs important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I‚Äôll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I‚Äôm still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum.net\n- 9minecraft.net\n- ign.com\n- 8minecraft.com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot.it\n- minecraft-inside.ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new Minecraft art style! &lt;3*\n\n ","published":"2021-03-03T07:54:19.305062Z","updated":"2024-01-28T14:32:01.035256Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":64039,"followers":171,"categories":["equipment","magic","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-rc1","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["W2XUMxdH","PNmr2iGU","QyXldeI1","CujvY5kV","jDkpjBJZ","k1biqr1E","YkqwMXcq","114GATGr","enpp5Ldu","Z3fyvKQ5","tAu1NVUt","b9ArwEwV","TpwPJBqV","p6wL4IL7","Xc7L1V6F","on6IEEcc","pzSRx3lI","Hp9hpnqj","IHospzO1"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n0S5OkPo/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"on6IEEcc","project_id":"n0S5OkPo","author_id":"EJcF9xaL","featured":false,"name":"Extra Alchemy 1.10.0","version_number":"1.10.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-30T19:01:40.554311Z","downloads":28019,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"2206cd9274f0e6a698adcdc22e1748b1a9240294e9ebe09d15a33ea9eb7fce3ebd96da9428fbe68fad70226835a3a2528f83e08af4d579b9975ad2755a3cdae9","sha1":"d1175cf372fd9d6f5cf063a67511e62fbe83feae"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n0S5OkPo/versions/on6IEEcc/extraalchemy-fabric-1.20.1-1.10.0.jar","filename":"extraalchemy-fabric-1.20.1-1.10.0.jar","primary":true,"size":1234909,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"t5W7Jfwy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"bGfsSwPy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"5aaWibi9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8spxJ5qd","user":{"id":"EJcF9xaL","username":"zabi94","name":"ZaBi94","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11521878?v=4","bio":"Just a guy having fun coding, to hopefully make a job out of this.","created":"2020-10-19T16:32:22.581413Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"extraalchemy-fabric-1.20.1-1.10.0.jar"},"mods\\create-1.20.1-0.5.1.f.jar":{"sha512":"426c1ce8b9cbaa3b3d6964ff5669401734146648ae024b14ea1e7bfc0768fb768310a7e464b81d40eac1cf07b24c4a7b01c84dfc879ed637c05947c6b6516961","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LNytGWDc","slug":"create","project_type":"mod","team":"yyROG8qL","title":"Create","description":"Aesthetic Technology that empowers the Player","body":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rR8W-f9YhYA\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Installation Requirements\n\n<p><a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KAgud6s.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://neoforged.net/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/90zvX3m.png\" width=\"160\" /></a></p>\n<p>This version of Create runs on <a href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\">Forge</a> and <a href=\"https://neoforged.net/\">NeoForge</a>.

(`styledchat.main`, available by default)\n- `/styledchat reload` - Reloads configuration and styles (requires `styledchat.reload`)\n- `/styledchat set <player> <type> <value>` - Changes personal <player>'s style of <type> to <value> (requires `styledchat.set`)\n- `/styledchat get <player> <type>` - Sends <player>'s style of <type>  (requires `styledchat.get`)\n- `/styledchat clear <player> <type>` - Clears <player>'s style of <type> (requires `styledchat.clear`)\n\n## Configuration:\nYou can find config file in `./config/styled-chat.json`.\n[Formatting uses Simplified Text Format](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/).\nIt supports usage of placeholders from [Placeholder API](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/general/).\nAdditionally, every message type has few own local variables.\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"CONFIG_VERSION_DONT_TOUCH_THIS\": 3,\n  \"_comment\": \"Before changing anything, see https://github.com/Patbox/StyledChat#configuration\",\n

or might be broken completely.  \nPlease refer to our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/12) and\n[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) for ongoing compatibility issues.  \nWhen reporting bugs, please make sure you are using the latest release of Connector and Forgified Fabric API,\nas well as **Forge 47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1\n\n### For improved compatibility with third-party APIs and libraries (REI,EMI,TR Energy), check out [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras).\n\n## üìñ About\n\nSinytra Connector is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to MinecraftForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## üìã Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install MinecraftForge. We recommend using version **47.1.3** on Minecraft 1.20.1.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## üîç Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.\n3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.\n\nPlease note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while also getting you a fixed version ASAP.\n\n## ‚öñÔ∏è License\n\nSinytra Connector is, and will always remain, licensed under the MIT license.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End.

Reimagining of Better Sprinting built for Fabric and Forge.","body":"**Better Controls** is a reimagining of [Better Sprinting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-sprinting) with even more customizability. It features several new keybindings and many configurable options for how sprinting, sneaking, and flying should behave.\n\nBetter Controls only focuses on complementing vanilla mechanics rather than adding new mechanics (such as [Better Sprinting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-sprinting)'s option to allow sprinting in all directions) that only work on client side and server owners must explicitly opt in to enable them. By not having such features in Better Controls, it significantly reduces complexity by not having a server side version of the mod, and not needing a way to completely disable the mod while the game is running.\n\nAnother major difference is the amount and granularity of options. Better Controls could be considered an *advanced controls mod* - by default, none of the keybinds are bound, and all options are set to match vanilla behavior. To take full advantage, go into *Options - Controls - Better Controls*, check out all of the available options, and figure out the best configuration for you.\n\n## Features\n\nThe mod adds **Toggle Keybinds** for sprinting, sneaking, flying (creative mode), walking, and jumping. You can use modifier keys (Control / Shift / Alt) for each, including for example setting Control to Sneak, and Control + Y to Toggle Sneak. If you press the original key, the toggle will be canceled (in the previous example, you can Toggle Sneak by pressing Control + Y, and stop sneaking by simply tapping Sneak).\n\nYou can also bind a key that resets all **Toggle Keybinds** at once. That makes it easy to for ex. turn on walking, jumping, and sprinting, and then turn all of them off again by pressing one key instead of three.\n\n#### Sprinting\n- **Sprint Key Mode** changes how the Sprint key behaves. You can choose between *Tap To Start Sprinting*, *Tap To Start / Stop Sprinting*, and *Hold To Sprint*.\n- **Double Tap 'Walk Forwards' To Sprint** can be turned off to prevent accidental sprinting.\n- **Resume Sprinting After Hitting Obstacle** automatically presses the Sprint key once you are no longer touching any blocks (helpful when climbing hills, especially if the previous option is enabled).\n\n#### Sneaking\n- **Move Camera Smoothly** lets you disable the smooth movement when sneaking or unsneaking.\n\n#### Flying\n- **Double Tap 'Jump' To Fly** can be turned off to prevent accidental flight toggling.\n- **Disable Flight Inertia** stops you instantly when you stop holding movement keys.\n- **Disable Field Of View Changing** prevents sprinting, potions, and other factors from changing the FOV while flying in creative and spectator mode.\n- **Fly On Ground** lets you fly while touching the ground in creative mode (and also lets you stop flying by tapping Sneak while touching the ground).\n- **Flight Speed Multiplier** (0.25x - 8x) changes how fast you fly in creative and spectator mode.\n- **Vertical Speed Boost** (up to +300%) adds additional vertical speed boost while flying in creative and spectator mode.\n\nBoth speed boosts can be configured separately for sprinting, which will be active when the Sprint key is held. Unlike in vanilla, the sprinting flight boost works in all directions.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe following mod loaders are supported:\n- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) (note: this mod does not require Fabric API)\n- [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)\n\nAfter you install the mod loader of your choice, [download the mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-controls/files) and place the **.jar** file into **.minecraft/mods**.\n\n### Minecraft Updates\n\nThe mod will attempt to load on new versions of Minecraft (including snapshots) as they come out. I made it that way so that if the mod works on a newly released version of Minecraft without any changes, I can simply mark it as compatible and you don't have to wait for an update.\n\nWhile this is convenient, there is potential for bugs which can affect server play. If you plan to use the mod on a server, please always use the latest version of the mod, and wait until I either mark the version as compatible with new Minecraft updates, or release a new version of the mod that is marked as compatible.\n\n### Compatibility\n\n- Better Controls is a client-side mod, it will do nothing when installed on a server.\n- If you run into a conflict with another mod that modifies the *Controls* screen, hold Alt while opening *Controls* to prevent Better Controls from adding its button. If another mod prevents the button from appearing, a button to open the mod's configuration is available in the Mods menu (for Fabric, install [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)).\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Options Menu Screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ANpj0aBF/images/9fed66f9f60a8d880fba24f5333ed7e11d1a7ae2.png)\n","published":"2023-08-28T17:03:33.441681Z","updated":"2023-12-12T15:09:07.650450Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2318,"followers":30,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rqRuy7UP","KG4EYTdX","zfAWRCmG","iUyy2aqi","zdmOEmpf","RSSArw7m","lC2Y9i2e","Wi7pUNrq","tda10jFt","IB4HufHQ","KmO1TSlL","AMG4PwRi","M1ZrVs3e","OFWnZwQj","ghK2evU3","Lb2x1ms1","87yLEyoC","OvZB9CKY","YCUoRK51","rT0CA9SR","YMqE2EQf","JeVyZvdv","91qx3d1j","pH5QhuW5","dCwhrzEo","EE77WlUh","cBVX5Stt","gmnrHzqp","H9eghR9n","f1SbNU0F","xjumEYGP","fX686AOi","BzSmcOar","7klK53zl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ANpj0aBF/d88dcf6b560adfec0437608b153de57e8e9ae15d.png"},"version":{"id":"H9eghR9n","project_id":"ANpj0aBF","author_id":"mL6r9Xal","featured":false,"name":"Release 1.3.0","version_number":"1.3.0","changelog":"<p>- Updated to Minecraft 1.20</p>\r\n<p>- Horizontal flight speed multiplier now stacks with vanilla spectator mode flight speed controlled by scrolling</p>\r\n<p>- Vertical flight speed boost is now a multiplier</p>\r\n<p>- Fixed Better Controls screen scrolling too fast</p>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-28T17:03:33.757677Z","downloads":571,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"07403096a416c60cfee6799c2abe22a956b010a7a435275d6e8b2140d65e5ad60e8bfb91a5e086235404a1e7d1f0f78cfc9a5eed5600ce83bebadffed043586d","sha1":"cb5403cfb66fdd22b193cf7a1ae99cf7bae1b57d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ANpj0aBF/versions/H9eghR9n/BetterControls-Forge-1.20%2Bv1.3.0.jar","filename":"BetterControls-Forge-1.20+v1.3.0.jar","primary":true,"size":92989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fGdMIZpd","user":{"id":"5m2P2LwC","username":"chylex","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3685160?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T05:31:00.453503Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BetterControls-Forge-1.20+v1.3.0.jar"},"mods\\EnchantmentDescriptions-Forge-1.20.1-17.0.13.jar":{"sha512":"1fafbabab0ee80712ae463dacf4fc0cb134881143151555dda88fe0033646d7629996ce4901683238071586b4cf9f057d3e8bc41826c2ff626ddd3a9e8a7bc40","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"UVtY3ZAC","slug":"enchantment-descriptions","project_type":"mod","team":"jJHDf5Y8","title":"Enchantment Descriptions","description":"Provides a way to get enchantment descriptions from enchanted books.","body":"# Enchantment Descriptions\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Enchantment Descriptions is a light weight client-side mod that adds descriptions of enchantments to the tool tip of enchanted books.

requires more XP than the last.  \n<br>\nSince Anvils and Enchantment Tables work off of levels, not off of collected XP, that means the higher your level, the higher the actual cost in terms of XP.  \n<br>\nTax Free Levels \"flattens the curve\" of the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs above level 30, meaning you'll always pay the same amount of XP, regardless of how high your level is.   \nIt also makes it so that renaming an item always only costs 1 level.  \n<br>\nMore precisely:  \nIf you are above level 30, instead of e.g. paying 3 levels, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from level 27 to 30.  \nIf the level cost is above 30, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from 0 to that level.\n\n* for Fabric Minecraft 1.16-1.20\n* required on the server and client\n* (it

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2828409,"followers":4063,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.8.8","1.8.9","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"17Hi340V","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:07:52.006115Z","downloads":193556,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"14f6b9b3161d6ebeaefaa1efc08b72a98d82aacf6f9956c3a5bff9daaae3d0200cfdb2034c2321849acf0aafaf0450cbd075a92138e1500f31a70666c59e258f","sha1":"a184f3a963c07f7026fb6d8ccd83ca29e7f7b009"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/17Hi340V/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":62127,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Prism-1.20.1-forge-1.0.5.jar":{"sha512":"b73de6bf581f5f28d86baa3eeb8ac0ff30aa9a35280da7fa528547bbb9e0aff5f931b434e143a4dfc4d11ae03ce52bc1cfa359beb8b656880e75bf1aa8d91b81","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1OE8wbN0","slug":"prism-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"PyFeuZCL","title":"Prism","description":"A library all about color!

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üìö Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents. Very useful!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üì∑ Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/577/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/578/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Right-click a shulker box item to extract contents stack by stack</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Hold shift to see contents of a shulker box in your inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üí° FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Its main features are:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lPE3bSGgok\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Sleds\n- Sleds are new way to get around Snow. Differently from Boats they curve around the terrain they encounter making them able to smoothly climb up and down slopes.\n- When going downhill they will also accelerate further making ski courses possible.\n- Sleds have improved mobility on Ice and while being able to slide on Snow are still able to steer and you can even bring them to a full stop by rotating the sled by 90 degrees, as you would in real life!\n- Chests can be placed on them to give some inventory space. Also works with Shulker Boxes and Sacks from Supplementaries.\n- You can also attach a tamed Wolf with a Lead to it. When Sleds are pulled by Wolves they will have increase mobility, speed and will be able to climb up with minimal deceleration.\n- Igloos can now spawn with an additional Sled with Chest in front that can contain some sweet winter loot.\n- Sleds can be further customized by placing Carpets on top of them. Doing so will additionally prevent freezing when sledding on top of frigid Powdered Snow.\n\n### Villagers AI\n\n- During winter time villagers will occasionally place down Wreaths on their house doors. They can only place one each and don't worry, they will clean them up when winter is over. Wreath placing can happen during idle time so at around 0 for example.\n- If you have Supplementaries installed villagers will also place down Present blocks containing some cool items. They will only be able to place one Present each and will do so during their meet time (after 9000) around their meeting point.\n- Baby villagers from Taiga and Tundra will throw Snowballs at any entity they see during their play time.\n- \"Winter Time\" is a period of time which can be configured with the provided configs and by default goes from the 20th of December to the 30th of January.\n- If you have Serene Seasons installed you can also make the mod follow its seasons instead.\n\n### Winter themed blocks\n\n- Ginger: a new crop that can be crafted into Gingerbread Blocks, a new decorative block. Wild Ginger can be found in Sparse Jungle biomes.\n- Gumdrops: they come in all colors and can be pushed by entities acting as a mix between a Button and a Pressure Plate that works on all directions.\n- Candy Cane: a sweet looking item, literally. Can be crafted in decorative Candy Cane Blocks.\n- Wreaths: can be placed on doors to bring some Christmasy joy to your house. Works with all modded doors as well.\n- Glow Lights: an item that can be placed on any Leaves to give it some glow in the dark action. Can be removed with Shears or broken.\n- Snow Globe: a block that will change to its snowy state when placed in places where it can snow.\n- New music disc: a new winter themed music disc has been added and can be rarely found in Presents and Igloo Sled Chests.\n\n> This project was made during WinterJam 2021\n<center>\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Me‚ù§Ô∏è\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

worldgen performance for a better gameplay experience.","body":"![Noisium icon](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/main/assets/icon/icon_128x128.png)\n\n# Noisium\nOptimises worldgen performance for a better gameplay experience.\n\nThe improvements lie between a 20-30% speedup when generating new chunks in vanilla Minecraft (benchmarked on 1.20.1 Fabric).\n\nNoisium changes some world generation functions that other mods don't touch, to fill in the gaps left by other performance optimisation\nmods.\nMost notably, `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise` is optimised to speed up blockstate placement when generating new chunks. There are also 3\nother smaller optimisations, that increase biome population speed, chunk unlocking speed, and the speed of sampling blockstates for\ngeneration.  \nIn `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise`, setting the blockstate via abstractions/built-in functions is bypassed. Instead, the blocks are set\ndirectly in the palette storage, thus bypassing a lot of calculations and things Minecraft does that are normally useful when blocks are\nset, but when generating the world only slow it down, this is a cycle optimisation.\n\nNoisium has full 1:1 parity with vanilla worldgen (worldgen without Noisium).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\nNone.\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\nNoisium should be compatible with most, if not all, of the popular optimisation mods currently on Modrinth/CurseForge for\nMinecraft `1.20.x`, since Noisium aims to fill in the gaps in performance optimisation left by other mods.\nThis includes (but is not limited to) C2ME, Lithium, Nvidium, and Sodium.\n\n- Distant Horizons: Noisium speeds up LOD world generation threads, since LOD generation depends on Minecraft's world generation speed.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nNo known incompatibilities at this time.\n\n## Download\n\n[![GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/cozy/available/github_vector.svg)](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium)\n[![Modrinth](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)\n[![CurseForge](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/cozy/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noisium)\n\n![Fabric](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/supported/fabric_vector.svg)\n![Quilt](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/supported/quilt_vector.svg)\n\nSee the version info in the filename for the supported Minecraft versions.  \nMade for the Fabric and Quilt modloaders.  \nServer side.\n\n## FAQ\n\n![forge](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/cozy/unsupported/forge_vector.svg)\n\n- Q: Will you be backporting this mod to lower Minecraft versions?

Unlike most normal biomes, these cave biomes are exceedingly rare - yet they all contain a variety of unique blocks, items, mobs and mechanics that makes them considerable subterranean destinations. These five biomes are the Magnetic Caves, the Primordial Caves, the Toxic Caves, the Abyssal Chasm and the Forlorn Hollows. \n\n \n\nTo find any of these cave biomes, you‚Äôll need to discover an Underground Cabin anywhere in the overworld. From there, you will find loot barrels with cave tablets and a Cave Compendium - a guide book for Alex‚Äôs Caves that should provide you with all the knowledge needed to find and explore any biome added by the mod. For more information on getting started, see the ‚Äò[Getting Started](https://alexscaves.wiki.gg/wiki/Guides/Getting_Started)‚Äô section on the mod‚Äôs wiki.\n\n \n\nAlex‚Äôs Caves is a very large mod with a great deal of effort put into the look and feel of each new biome. Each biome added may have its own ambient particles, fog, brightness, light color and more. Because of this, it is recommended to experience this mod without shaders, since many shaders can alter or worsen the unique appearance of several of the biomes. The mod also has built-in compatibility with Just Enough Items and Alex‚Äôs Mobs.\n\n \n\nAny additional questions can be answered on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/alexsmods), and bugs can

This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

Voice chat not connected<br/>Voice chat not installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224792461-c17f1ccd-61b3-49b9-8d6a-86c0f918e651.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Amplified Nether is **not** compatable with Incendium, but often compatable with other nether mods, such as Better Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n\n## Description\nAmplified Nether uses the new 1.18 features to create brand new terrain in the Nether, with 3D biomes and tons of new terrain types. This datapack holds its charm by adding no new biomes, items, mobs, structures, etc... a simple datapack to just make the vanilla Nether better.\n\nAdditionally, Amplified Nether brings back the Nether mountains from the original official Minecraft Nether Update trailer. Many players saw these beautiful mountains, and were upset that they weren't in the game. 3D biomes are used extensively, with much more biome variation. Biome borders that were previously impossible are now commonplace, as any biome can border any other biome!\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:46:33.906695Z","updated":"2023-12-21T13:03:56.140906Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":43749,"followers":280,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["FBqJR2QM","sB14azEN","70trp5am","DwobyjUi","QXFvBT1u","LGRU0B5J","txd1dBMw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/1e2c39947ef738f67d7987921dee474c307707e0.png"},"version":{"id":"txd1dBMw","project_id":"wXiGiyGX","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.2.4 ~ 1.20.4","version_number":"1.2.4","changelog":"# Amplified Nether 1.2.4\n- Officially supports 1.20.3/4\n- Added empty function file for manual compat with other datapacks\n\n(I forgot to update this two weeks ago - sorry!)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-21T13:03:57.854849Z","downloads":7947,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0e3e70402f3b462e33561b1b4d5cd14311b91ccd527c6f8ff76c1fad87ae20dd213f93fb9edaeb1e5ae90afd7f0e7f5edad8366ca8e51416d8a86530b477cc3d","sha1":"24d3b84cd127c74282f9d5613d67821f9fe27125"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/versions/txd1dBMw/Amplified_Nether_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar","filename":"Amplified_Nether_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":88304,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Amplified_Nether_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar"},"mods\\bettercombat-forge-1.8.4+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"d74428ea327fb94e766bd4733e7838ad9bb103db7752cca15569c71803a2d0739ef210e8329b02b32bb7baff943e0ea4ab96e1ff5b943339910cfbad8becf62d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5sy6g3kz","slug":"better-combat","project_type":"mod","team":"fVvaiaa2","title":"Better Combat","description":"‚öîÔ∏è Easy, spectacular and fun melee combat system from Minecraft Dungeons.","body":"![Better Combat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/images/6d65cbe745229c36b7b97cb608926374724d8174.png)\n\n\n# Easy, spectacular and fun melee combat system from Minecraft Dungeons.\n\n&zwnj;\n[![Modloader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loader-Fabric%20|%20Forge-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)](https://fabricmc.net)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/973561601519149057.svg?label=&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/KN9b3pjFTM)\n\n### ‚ú® Looking for vanilla-friendly content?

which grow slowly over time.\n\n¬†\n\nEnd Towers:\n\nEnd Towers are a new structure in the End.¬† They have multiple levels, and will eventually contain a boss on the top level.¬†¬†\n\nUnderneath them are giant underground labyrinths, which have a lot of loot, but come with challenges.\n\nElytra and other valuable items can also be found rarely in the maze's loot rooms, so be sure to fully explore each one.\n\n¬†\n\nThe Catacombs:\n\nThe Catacombs are a structure consisting of an opening staircase and a maze.\n\nThere is some great loot that can be found here, so conquering them is beneficial.\n\n¬†\n\nMobs:\n\nSpectrafly - Spectraflies are ambient creatures native to the Azure Forest, and change their color to match their surroundings.\n\nPurpur Golem - Purpur Golems spawn nearby end cities and will hurl you away if you get too close.¬† They are strong, so be careful when approaching them.\n\nHimmelite - Himmelites spawn in the End Tower Labyrinths and will swarm and bite you.\n\nEntombed - Entombed are the guards of the Catacombs.¬†\n\nStalker - A neutral creature native to the Crystal Crag. Breedable with Chorus Fruit.\n\nChorus Squid - Found blending in with Chorus Plants, they will propel themselves through the air to attack you.\n\n¬†\n\nChanges:\n\nThe Ender Dragon now has 500 health (Vanilla is 200), which will make the final boss fight much more difficult. (This feature is configurable, so you can set it to whatever you want\n\nEnd Crystals are now created with Rose Crystals.\n\n¬†\n\nConfigurability:\n\nThe biome weights and structure frequencies are all configurable.¬†\n\nThe Dragon Health is also configurable.\n\n¬†\n\nCompatibility:\n\nThe Outer End is compatible with both The Endergetic Expansion and BetterEndForge.\n\n¬†\n\nMusic:\n\nIn this mod, it features 14 new amazing ambient tracks!\n\nThe Azure Forest and the Crystal Crag have custom biome music, the end has its own custom creative mode music, and more survival end music. There is even music discs.\n\nThe soundtrack is a mixture of multiple artists, LudoCrypt, Pyrocide, BlueDuck, and Y!\n\nFor LudoCrypt's soundtrack, it is on Spotify, Itunes, and all other streaming services. It is also on Bandcamp here.\n\nFor Y's music, it was a collaboration between LudoCrypt and Y. This album features some of the mod's tracks.\n\nYou are allowed to use the music in videos, reviews, streams, etc. You won't get a strike or a claim for featuring the music! Though if its being used outside of a mod review, it would be nice to credit the music source!\n","published":"2022-11-21T08:17:58.269131Z","updated":"2024-01-21T15:56:01.420040Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":737,"followers":19,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["oUS1BNVk","SQtGxtFH"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/X8s97ySO/9ca9e2dafed0220e32d42bc34419fda53d7ad67f.png"},"version":{"id":"SQtGxtFH","project_id":"X8s97ySO","author_id":"lovyJOaG","featured":false,"name":"The Outer End 0.3.2","version_number":"0.3.2","changelog":"1.20.1 rewrite.

Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can

1.18.2+\n\n![Github License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n![Github Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n[![This is a Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20is%20port-Support%20the%20original-orange)](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot)\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a optimization mod and unofficial fork of¬†Smooth Boot¬†for Minecraft Forge 1.18.2+, If you have a PC with a older or lower end CPU (ex. CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the¬†[Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## üìñAbout üìñ\n</center>\n\nSleep Tight is a very comprehensive rebalance and **overhaul of the Minecraft sleeping system.**\n\nThe mod's main goals are:\n\n- Slow down early game progression, making it so sleeping off the night isn't always a no-brainer\n- Rewards player for prioritizing their \"home bed\" instead of placing random beds down every night\n- Offers late game options to sleep immediately without setting your spawn point (and without associated penalties)\n- Expand the sleep system by allowing players to rest during the day\n- Adds some drawbacks and dangers to sleep such as nightmares, sleep encounters and bedbugs\n\nOverall sleeping should feel more rewarding and balanced while still being fun and engaging at the same time with its new encounters mechanics. The mod late game should feel like vanilla but with added benefits\n\n> The mod is highly configurable. Just want the hammocks with no sleeping changes? You can do just that!\n<hr>\n\n### üõè Night Bags üõè\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/dee42b5dd4643454e75db0a987a810bb31330bed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"197\">\n\n- A late game item crafted with echo shards and phantom membrane\n- Serves as a temporary bed that does not set your spawn point\n- When used will immediately place the player in sleep mode on the spot\n- Upon waking up they will go back in your inventory. Perfect for camping!\n- Does not prevent Phantom spawn nor provide any benefit\n\n<hr>\n\n### üí§Hammocksüí§\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/ce174aba2c57bc4ef7edb6632d848d1510f542c9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"178\">\n\n- Allow players to rest during the day\n- When laying on one you can swing back and forth by pressing \"a\" or \"d\" movement keys\n- Come in all different colors\n- Can be attached to either 2 fences with 2 blocks in between or in a 3 block space against 2 blocks\n\n<hr>\n\n### ü™≥Bedbugsü™≥\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/7406d71aaed17430f670c918555400a55bfbc804.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"263\" height=\"184\">\n\n- A disruptive mob that has a rare chance to spawn right after you sleep in a bed on high difficulties\n- Normally they ignore the player and sprint toward any bed close by\n- Once they reach a bed they will burrow in it making it unusable/\"infested\"\n- To solve this you'll have to use a potion of harming on the bed itself\n- Can pass through doors\n- Can also rarely spawn in the wild and will attack players when no beds are in sight\n\n<hr>\n\n### üè†Home Bedüè†\n\n- Sleeping at least 8 times in the same bed will mark it as your \"home bed\"\n- Once a bed gets marked you'll receive a new effect, Invigorated, upon waking up\n- Invigorating increases xp drop from ores and mobs for a long period of time making it a valuable reward for committing to the same bed\n- Be sure not to break or let your bed be infested as doing so will reset its home bed status\n- Sleeping even more nights on the same bed will increase the Home Bed level even further up to a max of 100\n- Home bed status can be viewed in a newly added icon in the sleep screen\n\n<hr>\n\n### üåíNightmaresüåí\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/e0ec71bed38bc049d458bf7249f26d4fb49f3e84.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"231\">\n\n- You can now lay on a bed or hammock without sleeping. This allows you to move your camera and access your inventory like normal\n- Successuflly sleeping will now have a cooldown. By default this will be 5m but some events, such as sleep encounters or nightmares will inflict much harsher penalties\n- You can view your current cooldown in a newly added status bar right below your crossair when aiming or resting on a bed\n- While sleeping you will see the current time on the left corner of your screen\n- Beds will no longer violently explode when in the nether. They will instead only make a tiny blast. You can also disable the explosion entirely allowing you to sleep there\n\n<hr>\n\n### üßüSleep Encountersüßü\n\n- Formerly known as \"bad dreams\" this is an old mechanic that was removed in previous versions of mc\n- When sleeping next to a dark spot you'll have a chance to get woken up by a mob that could have naturally spawned there\n- No longer are you safe to sleep in a dark cave!\n\n<hr>\n\n### üò™Sleep Benefits & Requirementsüò™\n\nThe mod offers many ways to customize your sleeping experience. Here are all the options that it offers with their default behavior\n\n- Sleeping requires full hunger (default off)\n- Sleeping requires an xp toll (default 0)\n- Sleeping will grant a status effect (Invigorating only for home beds as explained above)\n- Heal when woken up (default on)\n- Clear all effects when woken up (default on)\n- Consumes hunger when woken up (default on)\n\nAll these can be turned on or off individually for each bed type (bed, hammocks and sleeping bags)\n\nThe rest of the mod is equally configurable so be sure to check the configs for a more in depth explanation\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>\n\n## üíúMod Integrationüíú\n</center>\n\nWhen Heartstones mod is installed sleeping next to a Heartstone owner will grant both of you a regeneration effect\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ùìQ&A‚ùì\n</center>\n\nQ: This mod seems tedious. I just want hammocks and my op beds back\n> A: Just turn off all the difficulty features in the configs. The mod is entirely customizable\n\nQ: How do i get rid of bed bugs?\n> A: You'll have to account for that, hunting for them when you wake up if you hear one. Smart house construction can also help\n\nQ: I dont like X feature, how do i change it?\n> A: Everything is extremely customizable in the mods configs. Infact mod also contains some optional features off by default\n\nQ: Does this work for multiplayer?\n> A: Yes! Some features like nightmares will account for all the players nightmare change and a \"nightmare night\" will be rolled accordingly. Only the player that actually got a nightmare will be set on cooldown\n\nQ: Why does this mod nerf bed in early game?\n> A: Because being able to skip the only part of a day where mobs spawn above ground without consequences in a game built around surviving mobs seems pretty op to me. In vanilla sleeping becomes such a no brainer that you have no incentive in not doing it as soon as you can every night.\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Me‚ù§Ô∏è\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

populates some item, block and other tags (for mod compatibility)","body":"This is a purely technical mod with the aim to increase inter-mod compatibility. By \"purely technical\" I mean that it won't add any content to your game.\n\n### The Problem\n\nMod creators are encouraged to use tags where possible, e.g. when creating a recipe. If mods are supposed to work together though, they should all share a same base of common \"conventional\" tags, which group certain items together. Not all developers add their items to common tags though, which means that a person playing with many mods or a mod pack creator might need to create long lists of all items which fulfill certain criteria to add them to specific tags.\n\n### The Solution\n\nUpon loading a world, this mod will automatically populate some tags based on code conditions, covering all modded content as well.\n\nIt's mostly relevant for mod pack creators who need / want to configure mods by adding to specific tags - this allows them to e.g. easily add all armor items to a tag, because they'll all be bundled in `c:armor`.\n\nAs another example, all items which are equippable in the head slot will land in a tag called `c:head_equippables`:\n\n![Screenshot of the `c:head_equippables` tag](https://i.imgur.com/2E36FZS.png)\n \n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor an overview of the tags the mod currently adds, as well as the blacklist option via datapacks, [view the README on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/blob/1.18/README.md).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for new tags, feel free to post them in the comments or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/issues)!\n\n\n\nI hope this mod helps someone and makes their life a bit easier. :)\n\n----\n\nThe mod icon is a composition of modified icons created by Lorc and Delapouite, found on game-icons.net.","published":"2022-04-27T08:43:12.453767Z","updated":"2023-07-07T18:57:46.548975Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":105273,"followers":56,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["zTLVD3Ir","iLNm8Z6p","50kM3UvN","VoyNngbb","sXJE2Hnq","cC57ynct","ocD9XA8D"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ocD9XA8D","project_id":"8FdYDHF5","author_id":"g6LkRuia","featured":true,"name":"1.20:

All code is open source and documented. Some of its features include:\n\n### üìö Read the Structure Gel API Documentation Here\n\nFor an open source working example of this api, check out [Dungeons Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeons-plus)\n\nYou can find detailed information on how to develop and use this API by Minecraft version.\n\n**Latest Documentation**\n- [1.16+](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.16)\n\n**Older Documentation**\n- [1.15.2](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.15)\n- [1.14.4](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.14)\n\n## üß™ Latest Features\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWO5BqSd29E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Building Tools\n\n**The Building Tool is a new creative mode only item used to perform various large scale block alterations.**\n\n- It can be found in the Structure Items creative mode tab.\n- Right click the Building Tool in the air to open the GUI. Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## üç° Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## üçÆ Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build.

It has been moved to `SavedData` files to allow for more dynamic loading.\n\n## Block Entities\n- Added `IRotatable` interface.\n\t- Allows a block entity to be rotated and mirroed when placed in a structure.\n\t- Contains `void mirror(Mirror)` and `void rotate(Rotate)`.\n\t- Supported by vanilla's `StructureTemplate` (mixin), `GelTemplate`, relavent data handlers, and relavent Building Tool modes.\n\n## Misc\n- Added an abstract item interface: `StructureFinderItem`\n\t- Contains basic methods to get/set located structure info within itself.\n- Improved performance with data handler processing.\n- Some registry events have been deprecated. They will become NeoForge registries in 1.20.4.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-22T08:10:47.454204Z","downloads":6259,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d5d3ada50c8e0f05065e7d5e51619d6c6e71d16cb70a571350172c5ef1a577c52ceb0b9e54b9fcf16fb15d7354db3629dabcb7016ed8cf45665bcb15f2d75891","sha1":"cf2225192e43316ab2ce99368eb7c59b4b08ac58"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/versions/Wcqj3c1P/structure_gel-1.20.1-2.16.0.jar","filename":"structure_gel-1.20.1-2.16.0.jar","primary":true,"size":961824,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"JuGQbIAJ","user":{"id":"gu5i0AM2","username":"KingPhygieBoo","name":"Bailey","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17862210?v=4","bio":"Developer for Modding Legacy","created":"2023-05-12T04:18:16.951256Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"JuGQbIAJ","user":{"id":"QlRPeSYG","username":"SilverDavidMC","name":"Silver_David","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15661705?v=4","bio":"Programmer and artist for Modding Legacy.

It is designed to make cross platform mod development easier by allowing developers to use Fabric API as a common library to interact with the game's code on both platforms. However, it is not an abstraction layer, and loader-specific code still needs to be handled separately for each platform.\n\n## Using Forgified Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have installed MinecraftForge first. More information about installing Forge can be found [here](https://github.com/minecraftforge/minecraftforge/#installing-forge).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods`

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

automatic data and resource packs.</p>\n<p>Usually, data packs have to be loaded separately for every world. Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in.

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-01-19T17:19:07.095202Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1495312,"followers":1885,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"smEdHeFU","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.1+1.20 (Forge)","version_number":"3.2.1+1.20-forge","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Changes\n\n### Config API\n\n- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.\n  - The serializer should now never be called directly.\n  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious.

It also gives server owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.\n\nThe mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side. The mod already integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) mods. Make sure to update them to the latest versions.\n\nThe API of the mod allows the implementation of player permission systems to be used by the mod for some permission nodes (e.g. for having rank-based claim limits), with Prometheus, FTB Ranks, LuckPerms and the Forge/Fabric permission APIs having built-in support. It also allows the implementation of party systems to be used by claims alongside or instead of the default party system, with Argonauts and FTB Teams having built-in support. The default party system or claims can be disabled completely in the main config file.\n\n## Commands:\n/openpac ... - player config commands\n\n/openpac-claims ... - everything claim-related\n\n/openpac-parties ... - everything party-related\n\n/opm - shortcut for the party chat\n\n## Key Bindings:\n' - open the mod UI. Can be changed in the controls menu.\n\n## Configs:\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - the main mod config. Make sure to shut down the server before editing it, or the server might overwrite all your changes.\n\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-... - some global \"player configs\", although all of them can be accessed in game through the UI\n\n## FAQ\n### 1) How do I configure the mod on my server?\nThe mod is mainly configured through the main config file at _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, or sometimes _[server directory]/config/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_ on Fabric/Quilt, while the server isn't running. Server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, can be edited by OPs in-game with the UI (check your key bindings). Normal players can configure their own player config with the same UI. If the mod isn't installed on the client side, then you can use the player config chat commands instead.\n\n### 2) How do I use this mod as a regular player?\nMost things related to claims can be accessed with the in-game UI (check your key bindings). If you have the Xaero's World Map mod installed, you can view and edit your claims on the map screen as well, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection. You can also use chat commands to make/edit claims. Parties can only be created and managed through chat commands at the moment.\n\n### 3) Why are some options greyed out in my player config?\nThe server admin/owner can configure with the main config file option _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_ which specific options players have access to. Everything else uses the value in the default player config.\n\n### 4) How do I disable all protection on my server?\nIn the server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, disable the main protection option. Next, edit the config file _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Remove the main option _claims.protectClaimedChunks_ from _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_.\n\n## Supported Mods:\nA lot of (usually smaller) mods should be supported by the claimed chunk protection automatically. Some mods go above and beyond with the mechanics they add to the game or modify, in which case chunk protection is not guaranteed and should be manually added, either to this mod or with an additional one. Feel free to leave suggestions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims/issues) for the mods that you'd like to be supported. Please make sure that they are not already by testing it and provide an example of chunk griefing one can achieve with the mod.\n\nExplicitly supported mods:\n\n* (Since b0.8.0) Create - built into

Not only can you finally give them something to hold in survival mode, you can also freely configure all body parts to pose armor stands as you please. And that's not all! There is a set of built-in poses to choose from, a settings panel for various properties of armor stands, and also great tools for positioning the armor stand, even in ways where you can use it to only display items. And best of all: This mod works on servers without it! You'll need operator rights though. And when the mod is installed on both client and server, all players can use it freely without any permission requirement. Also a few additional features will become accessible.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üìö Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To use the handy new screen added by Armor Statues, you'll have to shift + right-click an armor stand placed in the world. This will open the last screen you were using. Switch to different screens using the tabs to the left. Quickly switch between those tabs by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Rotations Screen</strong> allows you to freely move around head, body, both arms and both legs. Rotation values are restricted to a certain range to prevent weird rotations. To unlock this restriction, simply click the lock icon to move sliders on the full range of 360 degrees. When moving the sliders with your cursor isn't precise enough, try clicking a slider first, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around with greater accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The screen also offers buttons for reseting the current pose, for creating a random pose, and also two buttons for copying the current pose and pasting it elsewhere. You can only copy one pose at a time.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The next screen is the <strong>Poses Screen</strong>. Here you are offered a selection of bult-in poses to choose from. After selecting a pose you can also go back to the rotations screen to customize that pose. Built-in poses are the same as found on Bedrock Edition, so you might already be familir with them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Style Screen</strong> gives access to some of the basic armor stand options. You can also set a name, which will show above the armor stand, directly in the gui, so you don't have to use a name tag. The <i>Sealed</i> option is only available to creative mode players.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Position Screen</strong> allows you to place the armor stand with great precision, you can also change the rotation. To be able to better see how you're rotating/moving the armor stand around, click the magnifying glass button to hide most screen elements and give you a clear view. When moving the armor stand around a lot it probably is a good idea to disable its gravity on the style screen.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Alignments Screen</strong> is directly taken from the <a href=\"https://vanillatweaks.net/\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>VanillaTweaks</strong></span></a> <i>Armor Statues</i> data pack. Here you can position an item or block held by the armor stand, and also hide the armor stand, so the item/block appears only by itself.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finally the <strong>Equipment Screen</strong> gives you access to the armor stands equipment slots via a menu. This screen only shows up when Armor Statues is installed both client- and server-side.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üì∑ Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Change rotations of every single body part</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Choose a built-in pose, or set it as a base for your own</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Set some settings, and select a name</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Move your statue to an ideal spot with great precision</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/59/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Enter focus mode to better see what you're actually doing</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use armor stands to place items in the world</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Set new equipment directly in the screen</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üí° FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I cannot edit armor stands on my vanilla server!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you have operator right on the server you are trying to edit armor stands on. When not present on the server, Armor Statues sends vanilla commands to the server to change armor stand values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

mechanics designed to make your encounters with the Ender Dragon more intense and fun.\n\n<a href=\"/mod/fabric-api\">\n  <img alt=\"Requires FabricApi\"

1. Modified End Towers\nPrepare for a unique twist in your Ender Dragon battle. All the obsidian towers surrounding the dragon have been transformed, though they look regular until you shoot the end crystal. This feature helps you keep track of which towers you've already attacked. But beware, destroying any of these towers will unleash formidable phantoms, adding an extra challenge to the fight.\n\n![Cursed End Crystals](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FGWvEfgd/images/0171cd0d4db4eaa0de8e4c40728d11fd3a1a1d4d.webp)\n\n### 2. Falling out of the end\nWhen you fall out of the End dimension, it's a drop into the Overworld. You'll receive the message \"[Player] fell out of the world.\" But rest assured, you can retrieve your items in the Overworld.\n\n![Falling out of the end](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FGWvEfgd/images/3cd768f897fc2f9b65de9703b4e9f1fb14798480.webp)\n\n### 3. Invulnerable To Beds\nYour trusty beds will no longer serve as weapons against the Ender Dragon. Whether the dragon is **sitting**, **landing**, or **charging**, it will remain unharmed when a bed is used. Prepare to employ more conventional tactics to take down this formidable foe.\n![Invulnerable To Beds](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FGWvEfgd/images/2825231883666ed14f803a5525e2a4e4f6b33d56.webp)\n\n\n### 4. Deadly Dragon Breath\nThe Ender Dragon's breath attack has been amplified, becoming significantly larger and more destructive. Surviving its breath attacks will require swift reflexes and precise maneuvering. Furthermore, a custom death message (build in, but unused in vanilla Minecraft) will be displayed to emphasize the perilous nature of the dragon's breath.\n\n![Deadly Dragon Breath](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FGWvEfgd/images/11f6fde13ef65bce9c3658c185d248f05e962ed1.webp)\n\n### 5. Custom Phases\n![Custom phase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FGWvEfgd/images/40915e275251fb92cdb44c032de6ebc0fd865b4b.webp)\n\n### 6. Overhauled flight pathes\nThe algorithm for the flight paths has been rewritten. I do not like the new paths just yet, as they have some weird quirks, but they are definitely an improvement.\n\n### 7. Miscellaneous Enhancements\n\nTotal Dragon encompasses various miscellaneous improvements, including but not limited to:\n\n- **Enhanced Hitbox:** The hitbox of the Ender Dragon has been meticulously refined to ensure a more precise and immersive combat encounter.\n\n- **Changed Knockback:** The knockback effect of the Ender Dragon has been enhanced, providing a more dynamic and engaging battle experience.\n\nThese alterations, among potential others, contribute to an enriched gameplay experience. Feel free to explore these changes as you delve into the mod. If you have operator permissions, the `/ready` command allows you to commence the end fight with suitable equipment for thorough testing of the mod.\n\n\n## Mod Compatibility\n\nTotal Dragon is balanced for gameplay with the mod [Combat Roll](https://modrinth.com/mod/combat-roll). It's essential to use this mod or similar alternatives for a fair and enjoyable experience when facing the Ender Dragon. In the future, a configuration option will be provided to balance gameplay with different or no other mods.\n\n## Feedback\nFor feedback and issue reporting, please visit the mod's [GitHub page](https://github.com/tomate0613/total-dragon) and create issues as needed.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nPlease be aware that Total Dragon is still in its alpha stage. Bugs and unexpected behavior are to be expected.

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-01-17T06:38:14.293149Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":828867,"followers":1545,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/5e127e83e3b55e3cebf32e3e8b355296ea62d87d.png"},"version":{"id":"uv7jW0CE","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 1.2.3","version_number":"1.2.3","changelog":"1.2.3\n\n- added the following animation interpolation methods `easein`,`easeout`,`easeinout`,`cubiceasein`,`cubiceaseout`,`cubiceaseinout`.

Not only have we expanded the amount of mobs in vanilla Minecraft that can be tamed, but we have also fixed several problems with these mobs, added new items and blocks to improve the tamed mob experience, and have introduced a new Pet Enchanting system. Asides from the new command system, most of these changes should be reflected in both mobs from vanilla and new tamed mobs introduced in other mods, like [Alex's Mobs](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-mobs).\n\n\nWith Domestication Innovation installed, no more will your pets have to sit out battles, exploration and more at home. Now they can join the fun without worry of permanently loosing them, or them being completely outclassed by other mobs and mods.\n\nFeature Breakdown:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Wander, Stay, Follow</summary>\n\nWolves, Cats, Parrots, Axolotls, Rabbits, and Foxes now have 3 possible states when tamed: Wander, Stay and Follow. These can be cycled through by right clicking on the mob. Now its finally possible to have your cats and dogs wander around your house instead of being frozen in place or randomly teleport to you. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Swing Through Pets</summary>\n\nUnless sneaking, the swing of your sword, fist, or any attack will pass right through any tamed pets of yours. They will hit any possible mob behind the pet as well. This means you are free to get in the battle with your pets without fear of hurting them! This change applies to arrows and other projectiles as well. If you do want to hurt the tamed mob, you can hold sneak during the attack. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n \n<details>\n<summary>Sweeping Edge Changes</summary>\n\nSweeping edge can now no longer hurt any tamed pets of yours.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Axolotls</summary>\n\nGone are the days of weirdly holding a tropical fish bucket if you want to use an Axolotl as a companion: These amphibians are now fully tameable! Simply feed a wild axolotl a few tropical fish to tame them. They can be made to sit, wander and follow like all the other tameable mobs. Note that axolotls are by default very slow on land, dry out and have low health - you have been warned. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n <details>\n<summary>Tameable Foxes</summary>\n\nTrustable mobs have always been somewhat scuffed in implementation. Thankfully, we've made it so that tamed foxes are actually tamed - and can be made to sit, wander and follow like the other pets. To get a tame fox, you need to breed two wild foxes with sweet berries and wait for it to grow up. Note that no matter how tame foxes are, they'll still want to kill any chickens and (untamed) rabbits they can see. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Rabbits</summary>\n\nWhen they were initially added to the game, rabbits were fully tameable just like cats and wolves. However, this was eventually removed. We've undone this change and made them like the other tamable mobs above. To tame a rabbit, feed it several Hay Bales. Rabbits only have 3 health by default and usually (see: Sinister Carrot) cannot attack. However, to make them useful we have reintroduced another removed feature: rabbits scare off ravagers. Both them being tameable and the scaring of ravagers are configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Frogs</summary>\n\nLots of people have frogs as pets in the real world... right? Now you can tame them in Minecraft with a few spider eyes. Frogs can be made to stay, follow or wander like the other pets, and will come to their owner's defense. They may have low attack and health, but they sure make up for it in cuteness.\n\n</details>\n\n \n<details>\n<summary>Pet Beds</summary>\n\nPet Beds are new craftable blocks that are made like so:\n\n![Pet Bed Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/KPuMzoc.png)\n\nNote that they come in all 16 colors.\n\nBy moving one of your tamed mobs onto a pet bed, you enable it to respawn there the next morning if it somehow dies. The visual indication for this is if you see a bunch of ZZZ particles appear above your pet's head: this means it has set its respawn point. To remove the respawn point, simply break the bed block.\n\nMobs can only respawn at dawn, so if your pet dies some other time you will have to wait until then to see it again. Pet enchants are preserved with respawning, but more on that later.\nThe respawning of mobs in beds is configurable.\n\n\n</details>\n \n<details>\n<summary>Wayward Lantern</summary>\n\nThe Wayward Lantern is a decorative block that can be crafted from iron ingots and a lantern. If you are ever so far away from your pets in 'follow' mode that they are unloaded from the world, they will eventually find their way back to the closest Wayward Lantern to you. This makes it perfectly fine to die far from home and not loose both your pets and your loot.\n![Wayward Lantern Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/DxNMqzo.png)\n![Wayward Lantern](https://i.imgur.com/vyGTkiF.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Feather on a Stick</summary>\n\nFeather on a Stick is a new simple tool crafted like so:\n![Feather on a Stick Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/P3LFZcE.png)\n\nWhen used, this will send out a feather on a string in front of you. The closest pet of yours will then try to move onto the feather to play with it. This tool is useful for getting your mob out of places it shouldn't be, like if it's stuck in a doorway or on top of a chest. It's also useful for moving a pet onto its bed so you can set its respawn point.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Rotten Apple & Sinister Carrot</summary>\n\nRotten Apples have a chance to form if an apple item despawns on the ground (configurable). These green, wormy apples can be fed to a horse in order to turn it into a zombie horse. Note that you'll want to make sure the horse is tamed and saddled prior to this action. This zombification process will also preserve the speed and other aspects of the horse. Zombie horses cannot wear armor.\n\nSinister Carrots are rarely found as loot in Woodland Mansions (configurable). They can be fed to a zombie horse in order to turn it into a skeleton horse. They can also be fed to a tamed rabbit to transform it into a Killer Rabbit, which can attack and is much stronger than a normal rabbit.\n\n</details>\n \n<details>\n<summary>Animal Tamer Villager</summary>\n\nAnimal Tamers can be found in villages in their own unique houses (spawn rate configurable) or can be created with a unemployed villager using a pet bed as a workstation. They trade a variety of items related to animals from both vanilla minecraft and this mod, including unique pet enchants(charisma). Their houses also contain some untamed mobs and sometimes fish tanks.\n\nThe Animal Tamer villager can be disabled via the config.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Deed of Ownership</summary>\n\nThe Deed of Ownership is an item that can be purchased from the Animal Tamer villager. By right clicking on a tamed pet that you are the owner of, you bind it to the deed. If you give the deed to any other player, and they use it on the bounded animal, then the ownership of the pet will pass onto them, making it effectively as if they were the ones who tamed the animal.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Command Drum</summary>\n\nThe Command Drum block has been added to automate commanding groups of mobs via redstone. Craft it like so:\n\n![Drum Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/yiCKvad.png)\n\nWhen interacted with, the drum will beat and change command modes, whilst ordering all tamed mobs of the user to follow, stay or wander depending on the beat. If given a redstone signal, it will command the mobs of the player that originally placed the block. The block also makes a funny sound if you jump on it.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Collar Tags</summary>\n\nCollar Tags are the conduit for pet enchantments. They can be crafted like so:\n![Collar Tag Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/xf0lLlf.png)\n\nLike a nametag, these collar tags can be renamed in an anvil and used on a mob to rename it (unlike a nametag, this is only for animals that are your pets). However, their real use is that they can be enchanted (configurable).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Enchanting Your Pets</summary>\n\nPets can be enchanted by applying enchants to a collar tag in either an anvil or an enchanting table.\n\n![Enchanting a collar tag](https://i.imgur.com/gytL7ov.gif)\n\n\nThese collars can then be placed on a tamed pet of yours by interacting with it. To get the enchanted collar back, you can simply swap it with any other collar, including an unenchanted one. You can view a pet's enchants by sneaking and looking at them.\n\n![Enchanted Wolf](https://i.imgur.com/eA9swxP.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>All Pet Enchantments</summary>\n\n35 Pet Enchantments are added, including 4 curses and 5 loot/trade exclusive enchantments. These are:\n\n- Health Boost I-III : Pet gains 10 additional maximum health per level.\n- Fireproof : Pet cannot be damaged by fire or lava.\n- Immunity Frame I-III : Pet gains immunity frames (1 second for each level) after attacked, donated by an energy barrier overlay. While active, pet will not be damaged further during this time.\n- Deflecting : Pet is protected by a ghostly shield which deflects any projectile attacks.\n- Poison Resistance : Pet cannot be inflicted with poison effect.\n- Chain Lightning I-II : When attacking, Pet shoots lightning that arcs from the target to nearby mobs. Perfect for dealing with swarms of mobs like zombies. Level determines amount of mobs the lightning arcs between.\n- Speedster I-III : Increases pets movement speed.\n- Frost Fang : Inflicts attack targets with frozen effect (ie. powdered snow effect) that slows them and damages them over time\n- Magnetic : Pet is aided by a ghostly magnet which pulls attack targets closer to it.\n- Linked Inventory : Pet can pick up items and teleport them to its owners inventory.\n- Total Recall : When below 2 health, pet enters a recall orb and is protected from any further damage until released by its owner.\n- Health Siphon : Transfers any incoming damage from the pet to its owner, if nearby.\n- Bubbling I-II : Pet attacks trap target inside a giant bubble which floats upwards and pops, sending the target plummeting to the ground. Level determines duration of the bubble. Only found as loot in Buried Treasure.\n- Herding I-II : Pet can be followed by untamed animals. Level determines maximum amount of followers.\n- Amphibious : Pet cannot dry out (if aquatic like axolotls) or drown (if a land animal) in water or on land. Improves movement underwater and allows land animals to properly swim instead of splashing at the top of the water.\n- Vampire's Familiar I-II : Pet regains a portion of health for each successful attack. Level I is 50% of the attack, level II is 100%. Only found as loot in Woodland Mansions.\n- Void Cloud : If pet falls off a cliff or into the void, a cloud will be summoned to lift it back up and towards its owner, if nearby. Only found as loot in End Cities.\n- Charisma I-III : Lowers trade prices if near owner. Level determines how great of a deal is given. Only given as a trade by villagers.\n- Shadow Hands I-IV : Pet gains dark magical abilities in the form of shadow hands that emerge from the creature. These hands deal melee damage at a decent range. Level determines count and speed of hands when attacking.\n- Disc Jockey : Pet is followed by a magical jukebox that can play any record on loop.\n- Defusal I-III : Pet will nullify any nearby explosion, such as from creepers or TNT. Level determines range of effect.\n- Warping Bite : Pet will teleport target away from itself when attacking.\n- Ore Scenting I-III : Pet will occasionally sniff out local ores and highlight them to nearby players. Level determines frequency, range and amount of ores highlighted. Only found as loot in Abandoned Mineshafts.\n- Gluttonous : This pet can eat any food if low on health to heal, ignoring dietary restrictions and negative effects of the food.\n- Psychic Wall I-III : This pet can summon a psychic wall of energy between its owner and any close monsters during combat. This wall will stop any unfriendly entity from walking through it. Level determines size of wall, length and frequency of the effect.\n- Intimidation I-II : This pet can occasionally scare all nearby monsters away from it. Level determines frequency and range.\n- Tethered Teleport : This pet will automatically teleport with you whenever you do when following. That includes through portals, via commands, ender pearls and more.\n- Muffled : This pet will not emit sound or vibrations. Only found as loot in Ancient Cities.\n- Blazing Protection I-III : This pet is surrounded by multiple (2 per level) blaze bars, which absorb incoming damage and ignite attackers. Only found as loot in Nether Fortresses.\n- Healing Aura I-II : When this pet or its allies are injured, it will create a circle of regeneration around itself, healing nearby mobs.\n- Rejuvenation : This pet can absorb experience orbs when injured to convert to health points.\n- Curse of Afterlife : If pet is slain, a hostile, zombifed version of it appears, with all the enchants and abilities of its past life.\n- Curse of Infamy : Pet attracts attention from nearby monsters, which will begin targeting it.\n- Curse of Blight : Random flowers, crops, grass blocks, etc. will wither and die occasionally when this pet is near.\n- Curse of Immaturity : Pet appears as a baby animal version of itself, and deals less damage when attacking.\n\n\nMost of these enchants are not compatible with each other and have varying levels of occurrence. See the chart below:\n![enchantment chart](https://i.imgur.com/6sXKEjV.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>A Word on Mod Compatibility</summary>\n\nThe Wander, Stay and Follow command system is implemented for vanilla mobs only. It is up to other mods to develop a similar system for their mobs.\n\nHowever, all other features of the mod like the pet beds and enchants should work with any tameable mob in other mods.\nEnchants from this mod are compatible with Enchantment Descriptions.\nMobs from Alex's Mobs should spawn by default inside some of the Animal Tamer's cages in villages.\nIf you are a mod dev and want to make sure Domestication Innovation works out of the box for your mod, remember to make sure your tameable mob's class extends TameableAnimal.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Possible Future Additions/Roadmap</summary>\n\n\n- Pet Shops in villages and Animal Tamer villager\n- Improved Parrot AI\n- Additional Items for small animals like cages and perches\n- More enchantments\n- Improved mod compatibility\n\n</details>\n\n[Join our discussion on discord!](https://discord.gg/alexsmods)\n[Report bugs of this mod on

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## üêõ Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## üéÅ How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ‚ùì What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## üñ•Ô∏è Need a server?

While I love fishing in Minecraft, I always found the amount of other loot made it an unreliable food source, especially with wanting decent quantities for recipes in mods such as farmer's delight.

excessively easy to produce fish the fish trap must be submerged in a water biome such as lakes oceans rivers otherwise nothing will be caught. \n\n*`Thanks to Vectorwing for allowing me to derive the

Mobs","description":"85+ New mobs with stylistic quality above the default game.","body":"![Alex's Mobs](https://i.imgur.com/Se0dRBJ.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is a Forge mod that adds 89 new mobs to Minecraft. All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

These essentially correspond to the vanilla regular and jigsaw structure types, but with better placement and a clearer json format.\nBoth types can choose from the following placements:\n| Identifier | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| `surface` | Will place the structure at the top layer of solid blocks |\n| `ceiling` | Will place the at the bottom layer of solid blocks |\n| `on_water` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are water |\n| `on_lava` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are lava |\n| `underground` | Will place the structure somewhere between the top and bottom layers of blocks |\n| `underground_surface` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the bottom of an open area |\n| `underground_ceiling` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the top of an open area |\n| `underground_buried` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, such that it is not exposed to any open area |\n| `underground_on_lava` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, in an open area on top of lava |\n\n### Structure Pool Element Types\nFormations adds one new structure pool element type, `formations:single_pool_element`. The element type allows setting a different ground level rather than vanilla's fixed ground level of 0. The ground level can be set through the `ground_level` key.\n\n### Structure Processors\nFormations adds a bunch of new structure processors.\n| Identifier | Parameters | Description |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `formations:random_bed_color` | - | Randomizes the color of any beds |\n| `formations:biome_replacements` | - | Replaces certain blocks, such as wood, bricks and grass, based on the biome |\n| `formations:fill_brewing_stands` | `slotFillChance`, `maxBlazePowder` | Fills brewing stands with random potions and blaze powder ` |\n| `formations:fill_chiseled_bookshelves` | `slotFillChance` | Fills chiseled bookshelves with enchanted books |\n| `formations:block_age` | `mossiness`, `degradation`, `disintegration` | Randomly replaces regular blocks with mossy or cracked variants, full blocks with slabs or stairs, random blocks with air |\n| `formations:random_plant_growth` | `minGrowth`, `maxGrowth` | Randomizes the growth stage of any crops |\n| `formations:respawn_anchor_charges` | `minCharges`, `maxCharges` | Randomizes the number of charges of any respawn anchors |\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Examples\nFor examples usage of the features, you can check out [<img width='25' alt='formations overworld logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KX1XC0Oo/623ec34d4dbc1ca9c5aa6477f9043e86bbaa899b.webp'> Formations Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-overworld) and [<img width='25' alt='formations nether logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cGvQGRls/2e21f4c247ad58965c320f037c4febfa9cf827bb.webp'> \n Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)\n\n## Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple.

The restore defaults button allows for resetting a single config file as a whole (you can tell a config has been modified when it's name is in italics). There is also a button for opening the actual config file in an editor. The copy to defaults button allows you to set this config as a default config to be used whenever the config is recreated (mainly useful for server configs when creating new worlds).</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/956/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">When a config is open, you'll find a big list with all config options and categories. The button to the right of every option will restore it's default value. When an option is hovered, a tooltip will provide additional information, including the internal key, description, range, allowed values, and the default value. On the bottom, the cancel button can be used for discarding changes, the done button will save all changes to the config file.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/950/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The path bar on top shows where you currently are within the active config file. But there's more: It also functions as a navigation bar. You can click on previous categories to go back to them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/951/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Searching is quite fancy, the current query is highlighted, and found entries are sorted accordingly. Results will be located in the current, as well as all subsequent categories. And best of all, the search field can be cleared again with a simple left-click.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/952/2021-10-05_16.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing more complex values such as strings, enums and lists is done via a separate screen. In this case, an enum value can be chosen from a list where all choices can be viewed at a glance.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/953/2021-10-05_17.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing lists on the other hand looks quite a bit different. All values are entered as strings and will be converted and checked automatically. Sometimes, the type of a list cannot be determined by Config Menus for Forge, so you'll be promted to choose the type yourself, or edit the option directly in the config file instead (not yet implemented). Also lists cannot be saved when invalid entries have been added, they need to be manually corrected before that.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/407/181/2021-11-09_23.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing server configs is a bit different from other config types. They exist for every single world, so to edit a server config from the main menu you'll have to select a world. When you're currently playing in a world this world will be selected automatically. This message is shown when Config Menus for Forge has to create the server config first as it doesn't exist yet.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/407/182/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This message is shown when playing on an online server. Server configs can only be edited by server operators. When doing so, they'll be synced back to the server and from there to all other clients. In singleplayer no warnings are shown and no syncing happens as everything is done locally.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üí° FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Can I edit server configs with this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> YES!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Can I edit server configs while on a multiplayer server?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes again! The only limitations are that you need to be an operator on that server, and Config Menus for Forge needs to be installed server-side as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can't edit Forge's client config!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> You have OptiFine installed, Forge's client config can't be used then. This has nothing to do with Config Menus for Forge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a server owner and I don't want anyone to edit the server's configs while it is running.</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Simply don't install Config Menus for Forge on your server, everything but editing server configs will still work for your players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a mod developer and I already added custom backgrounds for Configured. Do I need to do it for this mod again?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No, Config Menus for Forge uses the resources provided by mods for Configured as well. There are other developer options planned for the future though. In case you're unsure about adding a custom background to the config menus for your mod, check out the instructions on the mod page for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a developer and I want my mod to use these config menus. What do I need to do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Nothing really. Just ask your users to install this mod alongside yours. You don't need to add a dependency or anything like that.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

Travelling upwards in the End will lead you into the Upper End, which is like a massive asteroid belt far out from the end islands acting as an opposite to overworld caves, featuring its own distinct biomes, blocks, and items. Similarly you can also travel downwards too, and find the radioactive Enderneath or other rare materials to use.

New plants called \"springleaves\" are scattered about, which will launch the player at a high velocity depending on the direction of the springleaf. There's also an indigo colored wood-set called and few other decorative plants.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x6kwLkY.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1116\" height=\"473\" /></p>\n<p>A New food source called Bouncer Nuts grow under the indigo tree branches. These will eventually become too heavy and fall off of the tree, breaking open into a few bouncer \"mobs\" which will become squished and dropped as an edible item after about 10 seconds. Squished Bouncers eaten or fed to ringlings, but they cannot be replanted and will only grow off grown indigo trees. Furthermore, another new mob spawns here, called the ringling. The ringling will eat bouncers dropped from nuts or fed by hand from the player. When ringlings are fed bouncers, they become full and will begin digging through the indigo eylium below them, they will occasionally dig up ancient roots and rarely a rooting blade. Ancient roots can be eaten to submerge yourself one block into the ground, it can also be brewed into a rooting potion, which causes this effect for a longer duration. The Rooting Blade will apply that effect on hit for about 3 seconds.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YtHVhRs.png\" width=\"1128\" height=\"555\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">&nbsp;The Enderneath</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The enderneath is an upside down ancient overgrowth, hidden below the end islands and lightly based around radioactivity. Lots of irradium ore generates within the biome and new threats called \"stalkers\" lurk here. Stalkers are very tough mobs, some of the toughest in the game as a matter of fact! They'll try to knock you off the platforms in the enderneath giving you an effect called \"burdened\" in the process, which will greatly increase your falling speed. Furthermore, killing a stalker will cause it to drop stalker its meat and ocassionally its teeth. Stalker meat is a very good food source since the stalker is a challenge to slay, and the stalker teeth can be crafted together with bismuth ingots to make a serrated hook, which has extra range and will bring mobs to your position when attacked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>glow gourds, azure berries, and cerulean stalk are also found only within this biome. Glow gourds grow down from cerulean vines, and overtime they'll sprout open with fronds off the sides, which allows them to be harvested slices that cause radiation when eaten. Azure berries grow off of lichen-like vines. These berries are very useful as they provide levitation to any player that eats them, letting you save yourself from a fall or escape from the enderneath. Lastly, cerulean stalk can be found here, which is an opposite of bamboo that grows downwards and can be turned into a light blue wood-set.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6VBFhrg.png\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Ooze Seeps</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The ooze seeps is a biome based around ooze and bubbles, with mobs and blocks to fit that theme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ooze can be found here, which is a new liquid found exclusively in the end. Ooze has many properties such as :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items, projectiles, boats sliding across the ooze surface.</li>\n<li>Most entities will stay completely still and not sink or float while in the liquid.</li>\n<li>You cannot drown in the liquid.</li>\n<li>Going in the liquid applies a new effect called \"enderstride\" which teleports the player to where they are looking randomly.</li>\n<li>Ooze can speed up the growth of some nearby crops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Big gas vents that produce giant bubbles are littered around the biome. They also have different effects depending on what liquid or gas is placed a block below the lowest part.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eleviblooms, a new crop, grows here. Eleviblooms will grow in multiple stages only on chorloam, and when harvested multiple elevibloom berries will begin floating into the air, eventually falling down. Eleviblooms can be eaten to encompass the player in a giant bubble, which can be popped by attacking it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gloops are a new creature which is also found here. Gloops will occasionally harvest grown eleviblooms and then eat the floating berries. If they eat enough of the floating berries they will eventually begin dripping jelly, which at this point allows you to right click them with a bottle and harvest the jelly. Bubble jelly can be eaten for a new effect, \"bubbling\", which will encompass any hit targets in a giant bubble. Furthermore, bubble jelly can he made into a bubble jelly block, which rapidly increases the velocity of whatever entity walks in it to that of the blocks direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fumesplats also call the ooze seeps home. Fumesplats will occasionally fill up with ooze over time, and then splat the ooze all over its enemies, including the gloop, it's natural enemy. The splat causes a new effect called \"suffocation\". Suffocation will slowly drain the oxygen of any mob who has it, almost like air-drowning. If fumesplats are killed, they can drop a suffocation gland which can be brewed into a suffocation potion.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FGJWq6E.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1126\" height=\"569\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Gaseous Gardens</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The gaseous gardens is an upper end biome which is based around the noble gases.

Days","description":"Gives you control over the passage of time by allowing you to customize the length of the day-night cycle and alters the Minecraft sleep mechanic by accelerating the speed of time.","body":"A Minecraft 1.19+ mod to designed to extend the length of the crazy short minecraft day.\n\n## Notice\n\nThis mod was originally designed as a 1.15.2 mod. However, due to being too\nbusy to update to 1.16.5,\n[Hourglass](https://github.com/DuckyCrayfish/hourglass) mod was created. Now\nHourglass hasn't received any updates in nearly a year, plus there are new\nfeatures that needed added. I've revived Better days to update for not only\n1.19 and 1.20, but also bring all the features to <u>both</u> **Forge and Fabric**.\n\n1.19+ is a fork of Hourglass mod, with new features and some functionality removed.\n\n1.18.2 is a backport for both Forge and Fabric that contains all of the 1.19+ features and bug fixes.\n\n### Differences from Hourglass Mod\n * Commands removed.\n * Forge only configuration screen removed.\n * Syncing config updates with client. Now requires a restart.\n * Added better support for Serene Seasons\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod (optionally) **replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition\nto morning** by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass\nfaster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for\nany sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the\nduration of the night.\n\nBetter Days allows for **customization of the day-night cycle duration**, and can control day and night\nspeed independently. Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make\na day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more\nforgiving experience.\n\nBetter Days also provides a number of **time effects** that may speed up the progression of various\nelements in Minecraft to match the current speed of time. Some examples include crop growth, grass\ngrowth, weather, potion effects, furnaces, hoppers, etc. Most of these time effects are disabled by\ndefault but can be enabled by setting their associated [config options](#configuration).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nBetter Days is compatible with the following mods:\n\n* [Homeostatic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/homeostatic)\n* [Ready Player Fun](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ready-player-fun)\n* [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)\n* [Sleep Warp](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sleep-warp)\n  * If mod is installed, sleep system is disabled.\n* [Fabric Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-seasons)\n* [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons)\n* [Enhanced Celestials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-celestials)\n* [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark)  \n  * The Improved Sleeping module of Quark interferes with the sleep feature of Better Days.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)  \n  * The \"Nerf Clock\" Quark option breaks the bed clock in Better Days. Either the Quark tweak should\n    be disabled or the Better Days Bed Clock should be disabled via the `displayBedClock` config.\n* [Nomadic Tents](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nomadic-tents)\n  * Better Days is compatible with this mod. However, sleep causes an extra full day cycle to pass\n    after waking.\n\n#### Sleep Vote Mods\n\nBetter Days is compatible with mods that enable sleep voting or have sleep percentage systems like\nQuark and Morpheus, but they conflict with the sleep feature of this mod. These features should\neither be disabled in their corresponding mods, or the sleep feature in Better Days should be disabled.\nThe sleep feature can be disabled via command or file by modifying the `enableSleepFeature` option.\n\n#### Other Compatibility Notes\n\nThe Overworld is currently the only dimension supported. However, most dimensions in Minecraft\n(including custom dimensions) derive their time information from the Overworld and will therefore\nelapse time at the same rate.\n\nThis mod does not save data to world files and can safely be safely removed from a Minecraft","published":"2023-07-27T22:05:48.640506Z","updated":"2023-08-17T18:20:33.690463Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":8098,"followers":58,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["ppTvMkcQ","6QftivWi","TddICzRK","VaNOkVJS","VdjYMDVE","ibKtyTIG","9oJK1FwS","Dghw70lA","qFEeN1Wp","o8hjQvLV","wywWx0Ub","xUcSpIZd","Mqwb9p92","TzICWvRb","JzqHlPKT","5hMNExru","TSERS24K","5yfcESSM","Vz8xARIh","e1jJjulH","chsCXxGC","byzCvNSG","5doFox3Y","ftsoxL1c","EC94faYu","LmJGq8Ff","7eS9eKJN","McOXQE2j","MSEo61mh","CEKbQT8h","IOxiu3gK","2EB4O0kI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPLE214j/a808b6d89eddc9acc0f9c99c67f47643502afa34.webp"},"version":{"id":"2EB4O0kI","project_id":"tPLE214j","author_id":"lY1GdMaR","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE","version_number":"1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE","changelog":"Git Changelog Better Days Mod\n\nVersion 1.20.1-3.1.0.3\n\n - Release 1.20.1-3.1.0.3\n - Disable Serene Seasons fix by default.\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-17T18:20:34.973750Z","downloads":1430,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c30688f402b39bad8c2f6f6fdb9c541416c9bf8ad849602fcfe29b19582c3869e6b68e2ca6b7b9ec1f2e7edb28425815536f7e7de1064a0ab6d9e11111eb0cfb","sha1":"935e513d1e796556c58d796228d6ffeaba6b15f9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPLE214j/versions/2EB4O0kI/betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar","filename":"betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar","primary":true,"size":522254,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"SaCpeal4","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hurffenI","user":{"id":"lY1GdMaR","username":"wendall911","name":"Wendall Cada","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44465?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-28T15:20:50.298202Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"betterdays-1.20.1-3.1.0.3-FORGE.jar"},"mods\\coroutil-forge-1.20.1-1.3.6.jar":{"sha512":"e027cb458efa1a12093bf86cc7e0282e5c25e923102b313f350c3b567017a207d5630acd3add0cfad97672dfc0223a49a80c87139538699c555b8a7ef1a3480b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rLLJ1OZM","slug":"coroutil","project_type":"mod","team":"nnhTUinU","title":"CoroUtil","description":"Shared library mod for Corosus's mods","body":"Main Util mod with all the fixin's\n\nThis mod is a giant collection of common code used between all my mods.

It provides the player with strength and speed on lower health.\n\n### Chevon\n\nChevon is a new meat dropped from goats.\n\n### The Geep\n\nGeeps are the result of breeding a goat with a sheep. they cannot breed themselves, but does yield wool and chevon, and can be milked.\n\nAlso they are more frail with less health and cannot be dyed\n\n### Thatch\n\nDecorative building block perfect for your nordic builds!\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Mod Integration ‚öôÔ∏è\n</center>\n\n> If Windswept is installed, Chevon meat will be disabled in favor of its ones\n> Chevon can be used in some Farmers Delight recipes\n\n*Make sure you have enough ram!*\n\n*Credits to Ariboa12 for the barbaric helmet idea*\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Me‚ù§Ô∏è\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

mod that focuses on things other than rendering","body":"## BadOptimizations\n\nThis mod started off optimizing minor things and only increasing performance by a tiny bit (hence the name), but later started doing some bigger optimizations.\nMost optimization mods focus on rendering performance and optimizing Minecraft's render engine, but this mod's focus is on the things other than that. This mod is to be used in conjunction with other optimization mods like Sodium.<p>\n\n## Wait, what does this even do?\nIt does multiple things:<p>\n\n- **Avoid updating lightmap**<p>\n  Updating lightmap textures are probably the most expensive part of the client tick. During each tick, the client will do some vector math to calculate lightmaps for blocks and the sky, then upload that new texture to the GPU. However, this can be completely avoided and cached if nothing affecting brightness is changed. This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Avoid calculating cloud and sky colors**<p>\n  Rather than calculating the current sky and cloud colors every frame, it will only be done every tick, and only will be done if something affecting it has changed.\n- **Don't do F3 calculations if we're not in the F3 menu**<p>\n  You'd be surprised to see how expensive the calculations are to F3, even when it's not open. Notably, the FPS string uses `String.format`, a very slow function call. This mod makes that function only get called if you're actually in the F3 menu. Don't worry, this won't break FPS counter mods.<p>*(also, you really shouldn't be using F3 often anyway, it decreases performance significantly, use an FPS counter mod.)*</p>\n- **Don't do unnecessary FOV calculations if we don't need to**<p>\n  When you're spectating either a player or nobody, the game calculates your FOV factor (e.g. charging bow / potion effects), even if your FOV effect scale is zero. This mod removes this calculation if your FOV effect scale is zero.<p>\n- **Replace `removeIf` call in ToastManager**<p>\n  This one replaces the default Java `removeIf` call used in vanilla for toasts with a more direct one. The default Java implementation calls the predicate twice, which, in this case, causes each toast to get rendered twice. This mod replaces the `removeIf` call with an `Iterator`, improving performance whether toasts are present or not. <p>\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*","published":"2023-12-03T23:38:30.615171Z","updated":"2024-01-15T06:05:33.885600Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":53709,"followers":136,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["4iRxgKYG","7EtZn21b","LvWnmLrW","CMQm449N","QPNT0tat","ww747oVi","R5epQB48","7mkIryQX","N83O7mRY","tPcndzIs","Rya4Prxg","P1VV7yAB","osrW6S8S","5iiizW8v","NPtJUzCQ","xrCxVWjv","csMggyw8","pYctvKKH","ByJJBuGh","frxUrBuZ","f80P5Er3","ajq5p3Cr","lVUqygYP","6qzarF6r","py5wZc1k","9vTW5SzW","ouYuE0eo","RppoOA91","o0gYJCDi","x9zMt7t7","Tyi2q14M","QFKaP0NG","PY8WFC19","YPx40hkR","WZB4pQ3u","l5RWBdez","yK1K2DcH","pNkHByNm","tfPcVhXP","NepFM2XR","74fRkfKB","PXrqBQZG","O6GYJnvX"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"PXrqBQZG","project_id":"g96Z4WVZ","author_id":"MtdsrsRk","featured":true,"name":"1.6.3 (1.20.1)","version_number":"1.6.3","changelog":"- Fixed sky color transition between two biomes with different sky colors being different from vanilla","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-15T06:05:03.318362Z","downloads":10097,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c36a960292a38113ceab30aa1dcab6026e0fec0d","sha512":"c652173c0d209f6603e65b23b249728dcb61fdf520ee1957282ef6e36b52a57a77bd83d7da131add49c060b25cb0d586d8975044eff794255c75b5b21a0fb971"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/g96Z4WVZ/versions/PXrqBQZG/BadOptimizations-1.6.3.jar","filename":"BadOptimizations-1.6.3.jar","primary":true,"size":379313,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8syA22fZ","user":{"id":"MtdsrsRk","username":"thosea","name":"Thosea","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/MtdsrsRk/3f5159d38faa7b19426cc1ea6c76036a4e509c18.webp","bio":"@thosea on discord","created":"2023-08-22T16:13:26.975044Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BadOptimizations-1.6.3.jar"},"mods\\PuzzlesLib-v8.1.14-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"3f29a1b411eaa8fa4061e57b650d71fb8db6f6b8b42d97441ae19d3fd2ad3627879feb94b70d6824e064f5b6c572c1fe525559581933945ad2dd329fd5791eed","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"QAGBst4M","slug":"puzzles-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"ubZOU9rM","title":"Puzzles Lib","description":"Why's it called Puzzles you ask?

factory base (that you can't even see most of the time) lowering your framerate? This mod is what you need!\n\nOut of Sight simply stops modded tile entities from rendering if they are further than 24 blocks away, and you can configure this range to whatever works best for you in the config file.\n\nIt has support for entities as well, which some mods use for rendering fps-heavy features.\n\nIn a perfect world every mod is optimized and well tested together, but with modpacks commonly containing over 100 mods, this world does not exist. So I made this to make multiplayer modpacks more playable!\n\n \n\nPros:\n- Hugely better framerates near busy, complex bases containing lots of modded tile entities and entities (such as machines, lights, etc.)\n\n- Client side only mod\n\nCons:\n- more obvious pop-in of said entities and tile entities as you get closer\n\n \n\nTo live tweak the config:\n\n1. edit config/out_of_sight-client.toml as needed\n\n2. run `/reloadconfig client` in minecraft (might not be needed, might auto reload)\n\n \n\nYour mileage may vary depending on your modpack, but here's a video comparison with it On (left side) and Off (right side):\n\nThis video highlights how much the mod helps our particular servers case of bad framerates. There are times where the mod is getting 50 fps where without it is only 15 fps.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7huyL27_PC8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","published":"2023-12-02T03:11:44.100485Z","updated":"2023-12-02T03:17:05.476053Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1422,"followers":4,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["fBGV35VM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjbXWxYV/6cf482858f11f61ac435f5b131aded95cad76b1b.webp"},"version":{"id":"fBGV35VM","project_id":"sjbXWxYV","author_id":"lywbdcMP","featured":false,"name":"Out Of Sight 1.20.1-1.0.3","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.3","changelog":"- Updated to 1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-02T03:17:06.576187Z","downloads":1422,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ce590f533b2b1dd84703a71192221d4db296d51c","sha512":"ca47212adcab4c70f96c848da26799a623cb6d59046ae1fd1bb2cd7d86d978f7cb3f0f2658577e818d4b37ab4c03c11a4c6b23caacbec2b822c98cff7f0c5a97"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjbXWxYV/versions/fBGV35VM/out_of_sight-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar","filename":"out_of_sight-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":16100,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Uhsckcf4","user":{"id":"lywbdcMP","username":"Corosus","name":"Corosus","avatar_url":null,"bio":null,"created":"2023-11-15T01:51:34.216169Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"out_of_sight-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar"},"mods\\Tips-Forge-1.20.1-12.0.4.jar":{"sha512":"9792d5125f3bec4a79c58c454d9c038e1cdc29e962d84bdbf4175ad3180b9df2c86a426fcb08239b295b0968a578cc60ea3f4701565fe0cb88b9e8152d754466","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AMCbgyVw","slug":"tips","project_type":"mod","team":"SEOvZNdW","title":"Tips","description":"This mod adds tips to loading menus.

Recommendations for new enchatments or curses are welcome and appreciated.\n\n<br/>\n\n> ### A refreshing take on Minecraft's enchantments\n> Could I just say how much I love the direction this mod chooses to go with its sort of enchantments? Every enchantment is something I feel would be something Notch himself would have implemented if given the chance. Rather than taking off in a whole new direction, it expands off the ideas of existing enchant \"ecosystem,\" bringing forth a refreshing overhaul.\n> - [**Typhonidite**](https://github.com/03-JS/Extra-Enchantments-and-Curses/discussions/6) on GitHub\n\n# Fully customizable\nAs of version 1.8 and above, every Enchantment and Curse can be customized as much as you like. You can change their maximum level, the items they can be applied to, and much more.\n\nIt is also fully compatible with [**ModMenu**](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), which makes the configuration process much easier and more accessible.\n\nHere's a small demo & preview of what the config screen is like and what you can do in it:\n<br/><br/>\n<video src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107844615/282082546-00d48eec-29a4-467c-8a14-5bed3fc7eeb4.mp4\" data-canonical-src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107844615/282082546-00d48eec-29a4-467c-8a14-5bed3fc7eeb4.mp4\" controls=\"controls\" muted=\"muted\" class=\"d-block rounded-bottom-2 border-top width-fit\" style=\"max-height:640px; min-height: 200px\"></video>\n\n# Wiki\nIf you want or need more detailed info on any enchantment or curse, check out the Wiki [**here**](https://github.com/03-JS/Extra-Enchantments-and-Curses/wiki).\n\nKeep in mind that all Wiki info uses the default config.

If you're into combat, Surface also cares about you! **Maybe you're the one who enjoys traveling around the Minecraft world**, in this case, Surface is the best choice!\n\n##  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé   ‚Äé     ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé     ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé   ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé     ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé   ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé   ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé  ‚Äé       ‚Äé  ‚öôÔ∏è Features üí´\n\n**Surface has a distinctive approach to introducing new features to the game**, primarily through exploring the vast world of Minecraft.

Allows for compatiblity with Fabric mods that require it,\nbut wouldn't otherwise be compatible due to the heavy forge mixin conflicts of the original version.\n\n### Architectury API Bridge\n\nRegisters mod event buses of Fabric mods to [Architectury](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) Forge to avoid registry init issues.\n\n### Terrablender Bridge\n\nRuns the `terrablender` of Fabric mods on Forge, making their usage with the Forge version\nof [TerraBlender](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/TerraBlender) possible.  \n\n### Geckolib\n\nGeckolib Forge is incompatible with most Fabric mods that use Geckolib for Fabric. In these cases, Geckolib Fabric must\nbe used instead. Connector Extras fixes a few issues that have arised with this version:\n- To improve compatibility, we bridge Gekolib's `RenderProvider` to Forge, fixing an issue that turned\nsome items invisible.\n- Initialize `Minecraft#resourceManager` before Connector loads fabric mods, which is required to run Geckolib Fabric\n\n### ModMenu\n\nIntegrates ModMenu the config screen factory with Forge's mod list gui.\n\n### Continuity Compat\n\nFixes Continuity's connected textures for modded blocks. By default, Continuity builds a map of model IDs to all registered blocks in its client initializer (`ModelWrappingHandler#createBlockStateModelIdMap`). However, this is too soon as it happens before blocks of Forge mods are registered. As a results, CTM models will not be created for Forge mod blocks. To fix this issue, we patch Continuity to move the block state map initialization from Fabric's client entrypoint to FML's client setup event, which is fired after registration has completed.\n\n### Amecs API - Forge port\n\nA Forge port of the Fabric [Amecs API](https://github.com/Siphalor/amecs-api)\nlibrary, implemented alongside Forge's key modifier system. Allows for compatiblity with Fabric mods that require it,\nbut wouldn't otherwise be compatible due to the heavy forge mixin conflicts of the original version.\n\n### Forge Config API Port - Forge bridge\n\nA clean implementation of [Forge Config API Port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric)\non Forge, allowing Fabric mods to easily access the Forge config system and register their own configs.\n\n## üîç Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble using Connector Extras or believe it is not functioning correctly, ask us\non [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Sinytra/ConnectorExtras/discussions), our discord, or open an issue in this\nrepository.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n\n1.

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>A complete overhaul of Minecraft's Nether fortresses!</b> YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses completely redesigns Nether fortresses from the ground up. Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts¬†‚Äî the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature¬†‚Äî Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"

This is capped by the player's block reach distance.\n\nYou are allowed to use this mod in any modpack.","published":"2022-11-20T22:08:54.031136Z","updated":"2023-12-10T13:28:27.530029Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":79199,"followers":215,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["ZGamMOvX","yINjQ1lB","LXRyDeg0","EzTj5ssf","Brq3aRUX","750n2ER4","ShRYww3i","mLqbWtrs","H7GjGSiV","XBTgJEYl","TIZ1pXGN","vPtybpyi","qv4N0o7x","kfUyR9c4","pRcd7ST4","chIzzjRQ","T1eFly6W","3DULg3qo","2qCUCDrD","5VaPxryH","2gEpTXyB","gfyCf0JH","NYlMtDNk","gBDMhF2c","J1KOCf5Q","xcUEOgSz","zwvpqRag","rA1fS1z3","dDkA7QhU","s1n7PxKZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VKXzIykF/f03ccffaebbfc0faa496a34e674090f3a11a99db.png"},"version":{"id":"s1n7PxKZ","project_id":"VKXzIykF","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":true,"name":"1.20.1-v1.3.4","version_number":"v1.3.4","changelog":"- Fix not being able to sit on Snow!

It can be used for patching biomes, loot tables, models, and most other json files in the game. Whenever Mojang makes entity models data-driven, Patched will likely be able to patch those too, allowing for a basic alternative to OptiFine's CEM.\n\nHere's a list of a few different things one can achieve using Patched:\n* Removing or adding world gen features to biomes\n* Removing or adding criteria to advancements\n* Removing or adding loot to loot tables\n* Modifying recipes\n* And much more!\n\nPatched is intended to reduce conflicts between data/resource packs as well as between other mods.\nIt's also intended to ease the maintenance of these files, as you don't have to worry about other parts of the file becoming out of date (such as Minecraft updates that modify a biome you're changing an unrelated part of).\n\nPatched also comes with a few commands to inspect the state of the game (`/patchedc` for client-side):\n* `/patched list packs` shows a list of packs that have patches\n* `/patched list patches <pack>` shows a list of patches provided by a given pack\n* `/patched dump patch <pack> <name>` shows the contents of the patch provided by a specified pack\n* `/patched dump file <name>` shows the contents of a file, with comments indicating changes made to the file and by who\n\n## How it works\n\nPatched allows creating these so-called \"patch\" files with the same name as the file being patched.\nThese patches follow the syntax of [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902), with extra features to make it better in a modding context. The patch syntax is documented [here](https://github.com/EnderTurret/Patched/blob/main/docs/patches/operations.md) and there is a guide to authoring patches [here](https://github.com/EnderTurret/Patched/blob/main/docs/patches/patching_guide.md).\nFor example, to remove gravel from plains biomes:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"op\": \"find\",\n  \"path\": \"/features/6\",\n  \"test\": {\n    \"path\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"minecraft:ore_gravel\"\n  },\n  \"then\": {\n    \"op\": \"remove\",\n    \"path\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis patch would then be placed in a data pack at the location `data/minecraft/worldgen/biome` with the name `plains.json.patch`.\n\nIn order to be as performant as possible, Patched only looks for patches in packs that say they have any (i.e., it's on an opt-in basis). This is to avoid looking in all 200 some mods in your modpack even though only one actually has patches in it. A pack can enable patching by having this in its `pack.mcmeta`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pack\": {\n    \"patched:has_patches\": true // Indicates to Patched that this pack would like to patch things.\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs another example, this patch adds a custom biome to the \"adventuring time\" advancement:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"/criteria/mydatapack:mybiome\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"player\": [\n          {\n            \"condition\": \"minecraft:entity_properties\",\n            \"entity\": \"this\",\n            \"predicate\": {\n              \"location\": {\n                \"biome\": \"mydatapack:mybiome\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"trigger\": \"minecraft:location\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"/requirements/-\",\n    \"value\": [ \"mydatapack:mybiome\" ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nPatched hooks into the base resource loading code, allowing *any* json file to be patched -- even other patches (in theory). This will be compatible with the majority of mods, as they will have no need to modify this code, and any mod using Minecraft's resource loading (which is kind of a requirement) will gain the benefits of Patched. However, some mods may *also* change this resource loading code, which will cause at best lack of functionality and at worst crashes.\n\n## Limitations\n\nUnfortunately, there is one kind of json files that cannot be patched. Currently, that would be tags, which is because of how Minecraft loads them from each pack to merge them. Resources that are loaded in a similar style will also suffer from this problem.\n\nIn addition to this, on versions older than 1.19.3, vanilla biomes cannot be (directly) patched. This is because in these versions those biomes are hard-coded -- that is, there is no file to patch. This can be worked around by having a prior data pack add the biomes from say, the world gen export [here](https://github.com/slicedlime/examples), but I would just recommend updating to 1.19.3.","published":"2022-07-07T21:45:52.524915Z","updated":"2023-12-16T08:13:07.900009Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":9019,"followers":35,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["V4VIRCIv","OVmyaspg","qRgtNm1r","yxSD0y9A","6R7c24oE","DyeRYxuc","WdQ0mrLm","D5qfWpum","ToUX3iQg","wTCqw0UX","3OZVo6u1","2ddjccEL","Y8apkNRF","Z9cCaAMk","xwCR2C1I","U1BubPIq","BkRjPUfu","D8cvUlPE","HxzWpkRb","bM6hedCb","FToWwuxC","6VvR1NN2","gJMHOBep","7IQ14kuO","8sohL0iy","YtygM4i7","QYq4DxAH","gmzYmlDj","U1hQ2yH1","yJpQNKdx","7IdaL5qH","NfYYrzMk","k0k74uDM","roRbqfNl","4qWgB4SV","DemVFTVi","VUXoCJFz","kYqdyb6B","JloZyBDB","9cvpIYTF","uQpHu1ab","3a33c3nh","o8zsTrZf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IBlGrJtC/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VUXoCJFz","project_id":"IBlGrJtC","author_id":"H3pa46Xb","featured":false,"name":"forge-3.2.3+1.20.1","version_number":"3.2.3+1.20.1","changelog":"##

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n¬†\n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n¬†\n- Custom map markers:¬†\nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n¬†\n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n¬†\n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows).¬†\nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n¬†\n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n¬†\n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Even if you don't use them, I'd like to know about it: [Google Form](https://forms.gle/2FMYYCYBEKTqXysv8)\n\n# Invariable Paintings\n\n## Overview\nTurns each painting variant into its own item.\n\n**No new item type was added to the game**, variant-locked items are the same as the ones available in the vanilla creative menu.\n\nWhen a painting is broken, it will drop the variant-locked item instead of the blank one.  \nBlank paintings can no longer be placed in survival, but can be used as crafting ingredients.\n\n### Dependencies\nSome specific features depend on **[Patched](https://modrinth.com/mod/patched)** (server-side) and **[CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)** (client-side), but both are completely optional.\n\nThe mod is mostly optional on client. The worst a client without the mod may experience is a desyncing issue when trying to place a blank painting, or when trying to place a filled painting in too small a space.\n\n**For 1.19.4, you should use [Patched 1.19.3-1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/patched/version/fabric-1.19.3-1.0.2) specifically.** Later 1.19.3 versions are not fully compatible with this version of minecraft.\n\n**For 1.20, you should use [Patched 3.2.3+1.20.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/patched/version/kYqdyb6B) or later.** Older versions cause issues with some feature used in the mod's datapacks.\n\n## Obtaining paintings\n### Trading\nFilled paintings can be bought from **Master Shepherds** and **Wandering Traders**. Shepherds no longer sell variantless paintings, this will not retroactively apply to existing shepherds.\n\n### Looting\nThis features requires **[Patched](https://modrinth.com/mod/patched)**.\n\nFilled paintings may be found inside of many naturally generated chests, most suspicious soils, and while fishing.  \nThe loot tables are provided as a built-in datapack which can be disabled.\n\n### Crafting (experimental)\n**Crafting of filled paintings is disabled by default,** it is only available as an experiment, and may receive significant changes. **If you enjoy paintings being rare collectibles, I don't recommend enabling crafting at all,** because it may considerably trivialize the process of completing a collection. For this reason, crafting was intentionally designed to feel obscure and a bit expensive.\n\nThere are several built-in datapacks that provide varying degrees of crafting freedom. More precise fine-tuning is possible by creating you own datapack. \n\nSee [the wiki](https://github.com/Estecka/mc-invariable-paintings/wiki/Painting-Creation-Recipe) for the specifics on how crafting works, and how it can be configured.\n\n#### General rules\n- The cost of crafting blank paintings was increased to **1 Phantom Membrane** instead of 1 wool.\n- Cloning is done by combining a blank painting with an already filled one; similarly to how banner cloning and book cloning works.\n- Filling a painting is done by combining it with dyes. The colour of the dyes has no particular meaning. The correspondance between each combination and each variant is semi-randomly determined, based on set of paintings you have installed.\n- The resulting painting is usually obfuscated until you take it out of the crafting table.\n\n#### Datapack Presets:\nNone of the packs are enabled by default.\nYou can manage them in the datapack menu when creating a new world, or using the `/datapack` command in already created worlds.\n\nThese presets may receive significant changes in the future.\n\nExcept for Cloning, you should only need to enable one of these packs at a time.\n\n- **Unbound:** The least restrictive crafting pack. Paintings can be crafted using any amount of dyes, using either a blank painting or an already filled one. This is the only pack were crafting results are not obfuscated. This already includes the cloning recipe.\n- **Expensive:** Crafting costs 8 different dyes, and only accept Blank paintings as ingredients.  \nThis pack can be used together with the cloning one.\n- **Iterative:** Crafting only requires a single dye, thus only 16 different variants can be crafted from a blank canvas. More variants can be crafted by reusing filled paintings as ingredients. This will work better with more painting variants installed into the game.  \nThis pack can be used together with the cloning one.\n- **Recycling:** The most restrictive crafting pack. Blank paintings cannot be crafted nor used as ingredients, making it impossible to create anything solely out of raw materials. Your only option for crafting one painting is to sacrifice another existing one. This will work better with cloning disabled. Crafting requires 8 different dyes.\n- **Cloning:** Contains nothing but the cloning recipe, which is not included in most other presets. Using this pack alone will make paintings closer to banner templates or trimming templates: You can only find new paintings by exploring, but once you find one, you can reuse it indefinitely.\n\n\n## Inventory painting textures\nThis feature requires **[CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)**.\n\nAllows filled paintings to have unique textures in the inventory, depending on their variant.\n\nThis is, strictly speaking, not a feature of Invariable-Paintings. It provides a built-in resource pack that is then used by CIT-Resewn, but does not add any of its own code on top of it.\n\nInvariable-Paintings only provides the CITs for the vanilla variants. For modded variants, CITs should be provided in an external resource pack. See [the sources](https://github.com/Estecka/mc-invariable-paintings/tree/HEAD/src/client/resources/resourcepacks/vanilla-cit) for an example on how to make one, and refer to [CIT resewn's documentation](https://citresewn.shcm.io/) for additional information.\n\nHaving too many painting CITs (around hundreds of them) can put a toll on the game's performances, so the embedded vanilla CITs can be disabled in the resource-pack menu.\n\n\n## Miscellaneous tweaks\n### Server-side\n- Placement of variant-locked paintings in tight spaces is more forgiving. (Vanilla would require targeting some specific block.)\n- Added a new loot function `lock_variant_randomly`, which can applied to painting items in loot tables.\n\n### Client-side\n- Fixes a vanilla bug whereby paiting items may sometimes appear to be consummed, without actually placing a painting.\n- Shows a warning when trying to place a painting in too small a space.\n- Slightly reworked the tooltip for painting items.\n\n\n## Compatibility\nAny mod that adds new paintings based on the vanilla system will be compatible, and their paintings will be obtainable through all existing  means.\n\nMods that bypass the vanilla system and implement their own, like _Custom Paintings_ or _Client Paintings_, are not compatible. Amongst the user-defined painting mods I know of, [More Canvases v2](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-canvases) is the one that is compatible with Invariable Paintings.\n\nMods that give you a Painting selection GUI, or that lets you edit already placed paintings, are not necessarily incompatible on a technical level, but are conceptually incompatible with the idea of collectible paintings.\n\n\n## Related mods\n### [<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ApVKpoIT/f22cd09bae6af62689cc402eb80f3d102b5190a9.png\" width=48> **More Canvases v2**](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-canvases)\nLets you register new painting variants from a config file.\n\n### [<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/y82xHklI/d374371a6c8082a3473d7b01614f19f9ffdb2607.png\" width=48> **No Kebab**](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-kebab)\nPrevents uninstalled custom paintings from being removed from the world.\n\n### [<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TR0G6vEd/b79a0a6e2d5003b96ac0d6b04c6802984204963f.png\" width=48> **Datapack Menu**](https://modrinth.com/mod/packrule-menus)\nMakes the datapack menu accessible from singleplayer worlds\n","published":"2023-05-31T20:31:56.891959Z","updated":"2023-12-14T13:53:12.472328Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1313,"followers":24,"categories":["adventure","decoration","game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tcOhImo","VH7XpWcP","LAO6pZv7","fRgBAIlE","xCmu0fL8","cfc5ze97","YFd18hGP","ddGrdLh8","atQYSWej","Ox0p6TXW","BlQSB2gs","Gsikl2hy","UhIVOq3C","I9yW4vey","ago0H54y","uIbe6Zq3","6TTTPr0E","xOuBXDzM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KodbCbpa/6c67d6ebec31c74f824d3d935226ab3c44ee1870.png"},"version":{"id":"uIbe6Zq3","project_id":"KodbCbpa","author_id":"QGuT44TM","featured":true,"name":"[1.20.1] 1.3.2","version_number":"1.3.2+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:47:46.912231Z","downloads":670,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6425620986ec59ac3a04c3f1af66a60b3068b911a2a82a6dd650aec3b04e4fa06fbd329c4f698edd2eb65e295ef1ffe0c6c9fa8015a9636e77b288dbd6708d1d","sha1":"ed1f80f401355c1cd52478209aee404d8f610452"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KodbCbpa/versions/uIbe6Zq3/invariable-paintings-1.3.2%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"invariable-paintings-1.3.2+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":242564,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"otVJckYQ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"kYqdyb6B","project_id":"IBlGrJtC","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"TbtheIlb","user":{"id":"QGuT44TM","username":"Estecka","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39855800?v=4","bio":"Y s'taient cach√©s les steaks hach√©s.","created":"2023-05-19T17:52:20.108949Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"invariable-paintings-1.3.2+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\radium-mc1.20.1-0.12.2+git.5f80f74.jar":{"sha512":"3fae49bc3c998f5d1e48e37ca7e92e27cf52016a2e2ce7843f01d30059df7bee2858f5a346aacf864be14865c4c817262a2059e2589fe65b007aa7f24c4a52cf","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2gvRmQXx","slug":"radium","project_type":"mod","team":"mxfdMdpI","title":"Radium","description":"Radium is an Unofficial Fork of CaffeineMC's \"Lithium\", made to work with Forge Mod Loader.","body":"# What is Radium?\nAn unofficial fork of [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) by CaffeineMC, on Forge\n\n# Canary\nCanary basically just disables some important Lithium optimizations, besides Canary is a hardfork and upgrading to upstream is slow, we act differently.\n\n# Modpack Permissions\nThis is a free and open-source project;

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2023-10-02T18:16:52.181784Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1604851,"followers":4028,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Z9FJWLMt","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T18:16:30.272151Z","downloads":403297,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b662fd625ba1f06c6e4958eac373856047d0d2a9","sha512":"2a42ef76cd2a60af01fffed1cd9e08270b537f116f7fa0ede49a5b526fa7b9860845a6f321c4a7600f80e739391eb24a6e6d9850c33894b58bc2d01a8a63f8b4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Z9FJWLMt/continuity-3.0.0-beta.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1050571,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\numeralping-1.2.1.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"d3192c8a6d12598966b18faa1f17ca23b3df0b09d0f103a0983df4e8142ed65adc234735b56557e4b40cd29c72180d9fa7885f7c126dc2641d2bed1c925b1e82","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XLd8Sh64","slug":"numeral-ping","project_type":"mod","team":"pzyOlb86","title":"Numeral Ping","description":"Display the ping for each player.","body":"\n# Numeral Ping\n## Important: you must also download [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) as of 1.2.1.\n\nDoes what it says on the jar ‚Ñ¢\n\nA Quilt/Fabric mod to show the ping of each player in the tab list (instead of the normal icon).

Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again.

But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b>¬†Also note that¬†<b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

Think two Dinnerbone cows being bred, the new baby cow will also be a Dinnerbone cow now automatically.\n\nIf two animals have names that are different when bred, their names will be cut into halves, and stitched back together. So a Dinnerbone and a jeb_ sheep could make a sheep named Dinneb_, or a sheep named jerbone.\n\nIf one or neither of the animals bred have a nametag, nothing special happens.\n\n## Interested? Here's some more in bullet point form\n\n* Two mobs with nametags being bred will produce an offspring also containing a nametag. If they both have the same name it will propagate to the offspring, otherwise a mix of the two names will.\n* This mod works on multiplayer servers without clients needing to download it\n* This said, in order to get functionality on single player worlds, the client would need to have the mod installed.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hnPEuPZPmw\" target=\"_blank\"

href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invmovecompats\">CurseForge</a> (Mirror)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThis is a rewrite of the previously separate Forge and Fabric versions.<br>\nMod compatibilities have been moved into an addon mod: [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/media/demo.gif)\n\nEnables moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.\n\nAlso hides the darkened background tint in inventories that don't pause the game.\n\nBoth features can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.\n\nThis mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.<br>\nI take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on Forge/Fabric/Quilt.<br>\nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) on Fabric.<br>\nRequires [Quilted Fabric API / Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) on Quilt.<br>\nFor Fabric, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to be able to open the config screen.<br>\nFor Forge, I also recommend [Game Menu Mod Option](https://modrinth.com/mod/gamemenumodoption) so you can change settings in-game.\n\n## Config (In-game)\n\n#### General:\n- Enable Mod: Enable the entire mod\n- Debug Display: Enables a debug overlay that can help debug compatibility problems.\n\n#### UI Movement:\n- Move In Inventories: Enable movement in inventories<br>\n  There is a keybind you can set to toggle this setting (unbound by default)\n- Allow Jumping: Allow jumping in inventories\n- Sneak Mode: How to handle sneaking in inventories:\n  - Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens Background: How to handle screens that pause the game:\n  - Show = Always show background\n  - ShowSP = Show background in singleplayer, otherwise allow hide\n  - AllowHide = Allow background to be hidden\n\nThe Movement and Background pages also have expandable categories containing toggles for individual inventory types.<br>\nThe base mod only has a category for vanilla inventories. For more mod compatibilities, see [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\nAny screens not handled by installed mod compatibilities are added to the \"Unrecognized UI Types\" section, grouped by modid.\n\n## Usage\n\nFeel free to use in packs if you wish.\n\nThe only official downloads are from the InvMove GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>\nBe careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>\n(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)\n\nThe mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/blob/master/COPYING)","published":"2022-02-20T20:50:17.872579Z","updated":"2024-01-13T05:51:54.299414Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":386768,"followers":812,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g6dHjPlj","Nw08AijY","zSjRFisS","KlCCrdyH","z1wUcYrz","Rowb4urF","FxtmKzFE","nyLttvyA","2PM0Ne3I","mXm80CHn","nc2YXBFR","ZUUyXFpC","KZODMPL5","YglVnx4G","AvfVeby1","aarEmm3o","VgnPhVTW","Clo0PUhb","FlJXgCDA","ODrlrF3Z","whx4cyXm","DjMssqvc","FJ91FXja","O575lNuT","dGo1L388","2tK5XdF0","um5St4s3","u2qv60JQ","sVkuPH9Y","qTu058ya","gn5FSncy","sWRkeaiE","LG7n0kA8","RKDVymOM","UTuW1mu8","RsLNtqpA","H2moqgPv","kzI0tILB","2sYsuomN","1uJ8OF0p","Q59zS7Fb","NudOSeIR","L9gZxJNb","VE4bOg3y","WzbaGwer","pfLgaUxC","hrMnbArx","920571eR","h6ELnOF4","JxGn75dh","vk2Y8XQV","WIXovitR","AE0sDDm3","W5h8ZaUy","kqq0UN1u","6CNOChud","1BZ0wHLG","LGhnGid6","VSooa0oK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/7c10ef4460c5b2998dac53a494ec9051851f0e76.png"},"version":{"id":"6CNOChud","project_id":"REfW2AEX","author_id":"U9xrZlQH","featured":false,"name":"v0.8.4 (1.20.0/1)","version_number":"1.20-0.8.4-forge","changelog":"(note: marked as alpha because I did not have time to test every version/loader)\n<br>- Update for 1.20\n<br>- Workaround for issues with certain freecam mods ([gh-19](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/issues/19))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-18T23:58:21.898641Z","downloads":35609,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f7d7a683c2e4899d013c207c1f11bee7f1f3354e47345972d9e3f60dcab411255755720520496c72ef79469ed2e07cf61a2890f686b70e055119fd4b119608e7","sha1":"5a68c14eca94747c78b4492c781612d17b450c05"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/versions/6CNOChud/InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","filename":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":125604,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"JoLgnJ0G","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"1rXrl5vy","user":{"id":"U9xrZlQH","username":"PieKing1215","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13819558?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-05-27T06:09:15.544829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar"},"mods\\transmog-forge-1.2.4+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"f716c04a8ec6f9a176600a3524b094e28f04e4791570bf1cfe3472107ace53f465499b8e564ff05b45fe17eb96c4e4446912a314e4d47dcf35aad0cf7f159231","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Th33t82F","slug":"transmog","project_type":"mod","team":"doyxZ4EN","title":"Transmog","description":"Change the appearance of your items without modifying their behavior/stats!","body":"# Transmog\n\nA Minecraft mod to solve the long-standing issue of not looking cool enough.  \nTransmog allows you to change the appearance of items without modifying their behavior at all!  \nIt works on armor, weapons, tools and anything else you can imagine!  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/woiAHnV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/emVdmtV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/5if3YW8.png)  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/27uCep2.png)  \n**Fully compatible with items from mods**  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rr4Hjk0.png)  \n**For more examples, look at the gallery tab!**\n\n# Items & Blocks\n## Void Fragment\nRequired to craft the Transmogrification Table.

The fuel slot. Every Amethyst Shard fills up the power of the Transmogrification Table, and each action will remove one third of it.\n2. The target slot. The item you place in here is the one that will be transmogrified.\n3. The appearance slot. The item you place here will be the one that decides the appearance of the target item and will **not** be consumed in the process.\n## Appearance\nFor most items, the appearance slot will serve as the direct appearance for the target item, the only exceptions to this are:\n* Transmogrified Items.

src=\"https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/banner.png\">\n\n## Overview\n\nDo a Barrel Roll is a lightweight, fully clientside mod that changes \nelytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.\nIt achieves this by redesigning movement with a \ncompletely unlocked camera orientation in mind, \nallowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.\n\n> ### Updated Forge version\n> Due to high demand, I've updated the Forge/NeoForge version of this mod to 1.20.\n> This version may not be permanently or actively maintained.\n> \n> If you want to use the config screen, make sure to install [Yet Another Config Lib **3.1.1 or lower**](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl/version/3.1.1+1.20-forge), as there is currently a bug with higher versions.\n\nSome subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,\nincluding but not limited to smoothing and banking.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra Roll](https://github.com/Jorbon/cool_elytra) mod by [Jorbon](https://github.com/Jorbon),\nspecifically it's \"realistic mode\".\n\nOriginally ported to Forge by [MehVahdJukaar](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar).\nModern Forge port based on [Sinytra's multiloader template](https://github.com/Sinytra/MultiLoader-Template).\n\nMod icon by

Forge port of Indium, providing FRAPI support for Embeddium","body":"# Lazurite\n\nLazurite is a Forge port of [Indium](https://github.com/comp500/Indium), created to provide FRAPI support for Fabric\nmods running on Forge via [Sinytra Connector](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector), as well as fixing incompatibilities\nwith some mods.\n\nIt is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Embeddium](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium), providing\nsupport for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering\neffects, and is currently not supported by Embeddium directly. Lazurite is based upon the reference implementation Indigo,\nwhich is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.20.1/fabric-renderer-indigo).\n(licensed Apache 2.0)\n\nLazurite is **not supported by Indium**. Please, **do not** report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker\nor in their Discord. Use Lazurite's issue tracker for reporting bugs.\n\nThe [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) and [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) are required to run Lazurite.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Which mods require Lazurite?\n\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Lazurite when used with Embeddium. These include: Campanion, Bits and\nChisels, LambdaBetterGrass, Continuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an\nimplementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n### Does Lazurite affect performance?\n\nLazurite's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves\nimpact performance.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">slime chunks</strong>&nbsp;mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Developers:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; white-space: pre;\"><strong>This guide should only be used if you are a developer wanting to using Blueprint in your mod. If you're a player, you may disregard this guide.</strong><br />Adding Blueprint to your mod is quite simple! First off you need to add Blueprint as a dependency to access the library in code. To do so, add the following into your <code>build.gradle</code>: <br /><br /><code>\nrepositories {<br />\n    maven {<br />\n        url = \"https://maven.jaackson.me\"<br />\n    }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\ndependencies {<br />\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"com.teamabnormals:blueprint:&lt;version&gt;\")<br />\n}\n      </code><br /> <br />Next you need to add it as a dependecy on Forge to make your mod require Blueprint when loading. In your <code>mods.toml</code> add the following block to the file:<br /><br /><code>\n[[dependencies.&lt;modId&gt;]]<br />\n    modId = \"blueprint\"<br />\n    mandatory = true<br />\n    versionRange = \"[&lt;version&gt;,)\"<br />\n    ordering = \"BEFORE\"<br />\n    side = \"BOTH\"\n      </code><br /><br />Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> in the examples above with the version on you want. For example, <code>1.17.1-4.0.0</code> will give us <code>blueprint-1.17.1-4.0.0.jar</code>. The example for the <code>mods.toml</code> is targeting the version selected and any versions beyond. If you want to target it differently, you may want to read up on the <code>mods.toml</code> spec. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Nodecraft\" href=\"https://nodecraft.com/r/abnormals\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oZS1R9g.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-09-18T17:11:12.586856Z","updated":"2023-11-03T22:12:07.276432Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":10851,"followers":37,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["LeFEEsj6","SnLXbWe9","W7LnjQML","aCCwv4Kz","mnMEKjNd","fEmF971j","L7ot1xtH"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/9311df94e37aa2c7a39cce14d118a263862fe9e5.png"},"version":{"id":"W7LnjQML","project_id":"VsM5EDoI","author_id":"q5duvarF","featured":true,"name":"Blueprint 7.0.0","version_number":"7.0.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T00:24:08.207392Z","downloads":1980,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5cf7ab755a9ef27f817c772dbe3d0b6f3d972b21","sha512":"8734846b80ab69f2f6ef199d0fbbe18bf12433e7da64c7f511ed5c9ce8b021d5045003f7199f476e469e3e092b6669b9aabb2d2f4fc14b7b449cb203d3355acd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/versions/W7LnjQML/blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.0.jar","filename":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.0.jar","primary":true,"size":958371,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"3u8PgG8F","username":"bagel","name":"bagel","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/3u8PgG8F/3c735084680f47dea218cca869655cfc245cd051.png","bio":"minecraft modder and coder and yeaher","created":"2021-04-29T17:41:22.849292Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"P53hwL9b","username":"SmellyModder","name":"Luke Tonon","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/P53hwL9b/02d85c2d067251dc276beec1c53ebf4ae05bcfb8.png","bio":"Software Developer, Game Developer, and Modder.\r\nMaking dreams come true.","created":"2023-09-18T18:52:46.978373Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"q5duvarF","username":"TeamAbnormals","name":"teamabnormals","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/q5duvarF/eba25e566c8678da285243ac416844c84dc7ef9d.png","bio":"We're a modding team dedicated to creating with high-quality art and design for modern Minecraft versions!","created":"2023-09-18T16:48:51.416757Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.0.jar"},"mods\\Item_Obliterator-FORGE-MC1.20.1-1.7.0.jar":{"sha512":"91a6e206d88a8ec8c0781a8e216fb5966dc128a44834bbf0afb1bc419ec28bf4204e4345b42adebbb804b1b2f630b35f4fba45b136a12336a9bb094c5b7accbb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3ESR84kR","slug":"item-obliterator","project_type":"mod","team":"eMo39BOz","title":"Item Obliterator","description":"A modpack utility mod that allows to disable items and/or its interactions.

And can be used as an optimization tool if certain items cause lag.\n\n### Specific Configs\n- **Disable Items Completely.** You can blacklist items to be removed with all features above.\n- **Disable Only Specific NBT in Items.** You can blackliist items that have specific NBT tags. Works with regex too!\n- **Disable Only Item Attacks.** You can blacklist items to only disable its attacks.\n- **Disable Only Item Interaction.** You can blacklist items to only disable interactions (Right-Click).\n- **Disable Only Recipes.** You can blacklist recipes only if they contain the item.\n \n\n## FAQ\n\n\n- **Can I use this in my modpack?**\n  \nOf course! It was designed for modpack creators to remove undesired items that may unbalance the game or create issues.\n\n \n\n- **Client or server?**\n\nThe mod is needed on both client and server. As it has some client features, but also server ones.\n\nCan work server-side only, but JEI/REI/EMI and creative tab removals won't work.\n\n \n\n- **What if I mispell an item ID in the config file?**\n\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the item won't be blacklisted as it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n\n\n## Example Configuration:\n\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each item you want to obliterate.\n\nItems can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:golden_apple\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"item_obliterator.json5\" (>=2.0.0) or \"item_obliterator.json\" (< 2.0.0)\n\n![Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050578253489917992/1197387350930620456/image.png)","published":"2023-04-27T01:18:17.693047Z","updated":"2024-01-24T14:10:48.936137Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":42459,"followers":54,"categories":["management"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","optimization","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["wStgh7KF","Z7O1PDF6","DhBs53zu","apfGL9jJ","TF654Ypi","hvb70HnH","pdDz3IHw","OgSArgH9","C1RqeDeY","9VoRHOKh","AttOhwKN","3Da2NymJ","PPE0fiKq","YOjk8208"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3ESR84kR/3262d2940ea87e5c5e33addce1f1a52d03366ded.png"},"version":{"id":"C1RqeDeY","project_id":"3ESR84kR","author_id":"Kp5oK4eX","featured":false,"name":"Item

being comfy at home? You usually would be forced to restart, even though you didn't really do anything wrong. Maybe\nyour friend didn't do anything wrong either. Overall I believe that death in hardcore is only fun if it feels like you\nreally deserved it, for example while fighting a strong boss monster.\n\nTherefore, this mod aims to solve this problem! When a player dies, instead of being gone for good, they enter a K.O.\nstate, at which point a timer will start running. Being the good friend you are, you can attempt to save them in time.\nIf you do, everything is fine - they get a small debuff and a strong appetite and you two can be on your way again. If\nyou don't, for example because you died while trying to save them, or you just didn't ~~care about your friend~~ get there\nin time, then that's your own fault and you can now decide to restart while in peace with yourself!\n\n## Features\n\n- Grace K.O. period before final death where your friends can save you\n- However, friends are not included :(\n- Locate the player and hold-right click to help them get back up\n- K.O. players can look around and chat, but can't move, attack nor use items\n- Works in both Hardcore and Normal

when a lava drop lands\n- Adds the ability to configure the rate of drip particle spawning\n- In 1.17+, the sounds for water/lava drips use the Dripstone sounds by default, and there is an option to use the old sounds if desired (like in 1.16)\n\nThis mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.<br>\n*(NOTE: If you are not using the dripstone sounds, the custom lava drop sizzle sound only works in multiplayer if the server also has the mod. This will hopefully be fixed in a future version)*\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) so the config screen works.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/DripSounds-Forge/releases)\n\n## Usage\n\nFeel free to use in packs if you wish (though compatibility hasn't been tested thoroughly)\n\nThe only official downloads are from the DripSounds-Forge GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>\nBe careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>\n(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)\n\nOther mods shouldn't conflict unless they do weird things with splash particles.\n\nThe mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](COPYING)\n\n## Upcoming\nidk, feel free to suggest things\n","published":"2021-05-29T22:06:21.629577Z","updated":"2023-03-15T23:44:14.302491Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":40423,"followers":49,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["P1zgwMvU","GCCurbcZ","k1mV0Ujm","FogyVtrC","U6cFBqKR","eCCQqQQ8","P1UiK8Ux"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XOhqdyTf/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"P1UiK8Ux","project_id":"XOhqdyTf","author_id":"U9xrZlQH","featured":true,"name":"v0.3.2 (1.19.4-1.20)","version_number":"0.3.2","changelog":"Update for 1.19.4<br>\nRework mixins since they refactored drip particle code this update","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-15T23:44:14.863050Z","downloads":24519,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e91743f0e4a1b8d2e1b795f3ccd4bd4190f5d4c3","sha512":"fbbc40537e34aca1ad760c20b69072fc53b407dbd02613c309e181db1a0db55f9515325dc33c6a9b2264e21560c97150fd69c8043aa3bfba98b8db228361d54f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XOhqdyTf/versions/P1UiK8Ux/DripSounds-1.19.4-0.3.2.jar","filename":"DripSounds-1.19.4-0.3.2.jar","primary":true,"size":79003,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"RljHCsum","project_id":"7V0nY9Tu","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"X8YuGurB","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"SVJQLxSF","user":{"id":"U9xrZlQH","username":"PieKing1215","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13819558?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-05-27T06:09:15.544829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"DripSounds-1.19.4-0.3.2.jar"},"mods\\emi-1.1.0+1.20.1+forge.jar":{"sha512":"8d519b1e703436c50384c0b3c33ccaca1be0141423faa75c5859a4212294a0188b25df4a98f9f38fa39f76d450281051d1ff8b25ddcc45785cd7b19b2bbbc104","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fRiHVvU7","slug":"emi","project_type":"mod","team":"OqEReJSr","title":"EMI","description":"A featureful and accessible item and recipe viewer","body":"# EMI\nEMI is a featureful and accessible item and recipe viewer. It brings many new features, and optimizes for the user experience. Outside of the standard Fabric/Quilt API, EMI requires **zero** dependencies, and can be launched with the game simply and easily.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/0d3b5b33d0016b21834ce6f3602169f7c48de13f.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/f3c8b452eae6dde028c37e3a3e3792459468d865.png)\n\n## Runtime JEI Compat\nFor runtime JEI compat, all you need to do is install JEI alongside EMI and they will work together to share recipes. JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material Information\n* Expounded Minutia Introspection\n* Earnestly Made Imitation\n* Even More Items\n* Eminence, My Inception\n* Emi's Magic Inventory\n* Efficiently Managed Inventory\n* Exploring Modified:

Use any of the below ways:\n    - just create a resource pack, add pictures there along the path `assets/emogg/emoji`\n    - convert the emoji from the discord server into a resource pack on [our website](https://aratakileo.github.io/emogg-resourcepack-maker/)\n- you can use emojis in chat, on signs and in other places where there is text!\n- when you enter the emoji name, emoji suggestions appear above the input field (available only for chat)\n- you can choose the emoji you like in the emoji selection menu! (available only for chat)\n- by default, two emoji texture packs are built into the mod at once, each of which you can disable through the resource pack selection menu, like a regular resource pack\n\n### How do emojis work?\nTo use emoji, you need to type `:emoji_name:`. If you do this in a chat, you will be shown autocompletion hints. The emoji selection menu is also available in the chat, which opens by clicking on the button in the lower right corner, or by clicking middle mouse button or by pressing `Shift` + `Esc`.\n\nIf you play on the server or over the network, then in addition to the fact that you and other players must have this mod installed, everyone must have the same resource packs added. If any of these conditions are not met, then instead of emojis, other players will see `:emoji_name:`.\n\nIf you don't want the emoji name to be transformed into an emoji, you can escape the emoji name by putting a backslash in front of it, thus: `\\:emoji_name:`.\n\n### How can I add my own emojis?\nYou can easily convert emojis from any discord server into a resource pack on [our website](https://aratakileo.github.io/emogg-resourcepack-maker/)!\n\nIf you want to configure the emoji resource pack in more detail or study the structure of such resource packs, then in this case, information for more advanced users is provided below.\n\nNext, the `assets/emogg/emoji` directory of the resource pack will be designated as the main directory or the main folder of the resource pack.\n\nTo add your emojis to the game, just add pictures in the format `.gif` or `.png` to the main directory inside your resource pack. Each picture added in this way will be automatically added to the game as an emoji.\n\nThe optimal resolution for each emoji will be approximately `128x128` pixels (this is not a rule, but a recommendation). There is not much point in a higher resolution. Emoji will look better in the game if there is not too much empty space between the edges of the picture and the content. It is better to avoid adding emojis with too small details, because they can be difficult to distinguish.\n\nThe name of the image file, without extension, will be used as the name of the emoji, which can consist only of lowercase Latin characters `a-z`, numbers `0-9`, underscores `_`. Moreover, the underscores cannot stand at the beginning or at the end of the emoji name. The name of the image file can be anything, however, when loading emojis, all names are modified as follows:\n- all spaces, dots and dashes will be replaced with underscores\n- the underscores at the beginning and at the end of the name will be removed\n- unsupported characters will be removed from the name\n- uppercase Latin characters will be converted to lowercase characters\n\nThe same rules apply to the names of the categories in which your emojis will be listed. By default, all emojis added to the main catalog will be listed in the `other` category. To link your emojis to a certain category, it is enough to create a folder with the name of the category inside the main folder and transfer there the emojis that will be attributed to this category. There can be any number of folders with any name between the main folder and the category folder, because the name of the pack in which your emojis are directly located (except the main folder) will be taken as the name of the category. This can be used to create a namespace. So if another resource pack has an emoji with the same name as yours, both your and the emoji from another resource pack will be added to the game.\n\nBy default, the following category names are already registered in the mod:\n- `anime`\n- `memes`\n- `people`\n- `nature`\n- `food`\n- `activities`\n- `travel`\n- `objects`\n- `symbols`\n- `flags`\n- `other`\n\nYou can add your emojis to these categories or create your own. Also, for these categories, translation into six languages has already been implemented: English, German, Japanese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian. You can [help with translating](https://github.com/aratakileo/emogg/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/emogg/lang) the mod into other languages. If you don't add a translation for your new categories using the resource pack language files, the folder name with a capital letter will be used. To add a translation of your category, you need to use the translation key `emogg.category.your_category_name`, where it is necessary to replace `your_category_name` with the name of your category. Each new category you add will be displayed in the selection menu above those already built into the mod.\n\nIf the mod detects two or more emojis with the same name, these emojis will be added to the game, but the names of such emojis will be modified. At the end of the name of such emojis, an ordinal number will be added to distinguish them.\n\nYou can find more detailed information on how to create your own resource packs on the Internet, or you can [download one](https://github.com/aratakileo/emogg/raw/main/resourcepack/builtin.zip) of the resource packs built into the mod as an example.","published":"2023-06-19T17:03:29.145794Z","updated":"2024-01-28T08:48:05.693438Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4631,"followers":57,"categories":["decoration","social","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["bhXTRDO2","rZcfrXBz","M0SgMZef","16KW7SQX","vhAiFtzi","rNxzvTSj","DjSMSorx","wl7Trsjf","IUIvaEyZ","2L5YH1pZ","dX5NIoDj","S2QKPSAH","DNWGyp7x","OdfwkIRs","HvgQgcJN","7PMfgNAP","2bzWMLpp","Fv6xwTPs","aCFTaX1v","VNulhIYR","bIbAXsg8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tyANotOf/59281e8b8d703522e4d052bde3164e4426e68711.png"},"version":{"id":"bIbAXsg8","project_id":"tyANotOf","author_id":"m2os4HrO","featured":false,"name":"emogg 1.0.1+1.20-1.20.1-forged","version_number":"1.0.1","changelog":"- port to Forge 1.20-1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T08:48:07.753157Z","downloads":12,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"20cef83cbaa64aa1556fb81dcbc985d93fb30307","sha512":"61322ed965d18cdbb351117762c38ceec50ba210c51c2a49e4b7fbf24ca4f8648062ad0966fb9791088d85e8c313a002e361e170fef3109e8df285af0d7794f1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tyANotOf/versions/bIbAXsg8/emogg-1.0.1%2B1.20-1.20.1-forged.jar","filename":"emogg-1.0.1+1.20-1.20.1-forged.jar","primary":true,"size":9250771,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"nesZ0JUQ","project_id":"vLGDpLdc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"u58R1TMW","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GHrcJOL1","user":{"id":"m2os4HrO","username":"aratakileo","name":"Arataki Leo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/m2os4HrO/a427403f4d1e3eee7a698b4e4cbd0163998a3eb7.png","bio":"Just Minecraft mod maker","created":"2023-06-19T17:00:53.180251Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emogg-1.0.1+1.20-1.20.1-forged.jar"},"mods\\octolib-0.1.jar":{"sha512":"a73b1bb86aff43a37c5bb074e57f67b59316ae3cb6835ff87c46b9591ac8b1e4cfa9da175bb77f59f4cdbab68485e5d036da316c527a0dab19157464554cc2fa","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"RH2KUdKJ","slug":"octo-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"GDxJXTjJ","title":"OctoLib","description":"Collection of shared code for SSKirillSS's mods","body":"Collection of shared code for my mods.

I couldn‚Äôt think of a name and called it the first name that came to my head as a placeholder ‚ÄúSully‚Äù, the name stuck and now people think my name is actually Sully. <br/> \nBack then it was made with MCreator and combined with the fact that I back then didn‚Äôt have a good understanding of vanilla feel, it became more limited each version. I decided to completely revamp the mod, completely dumping the MCreator version and getting a coding team (Uraneptus and MiteBeMana). <br/>\nWith each feature I try to think it out as well as I can, making sure the feature is well-balanced, feels fun to play with and overall just feels like something new. It tries it‚Äôs best to feel like a Minecraft update full of random features. The mod is planned to have features for every player, explorers, builders and redstone engineers.\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## üìùCurrent Features:\n\n**[Disclaimer the mod is currently in it's beta so many features are not yet implemented, check out this doc if you want to know more about the planned features: [Planned](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0-PYvZDjAtcMZySJMDEGL2xQSIM8Znr9rzibRzqDeA/edit?usp=drivesdk)]**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Jade**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Jade Flinger Totem**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Jade Shield**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Jade Horse Armor**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Copper Buttons**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Laternfish**\n\n**‚Ä¢¬†Tortoise**\n\n**‚Ä¢¬†Tortoise Shell**\n\n**‚Ä¢¬†Bouldering Zombie**\n\n**‚Ä¢¬†Jungle Spider**\n\n\n_If you want to know more about the indiviudal features, check our wiki out:¬†[Sully's Mod Wiki](https://github.com/Uraneptus/Sullys-Mod/wiki)_\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## üíº Dev team:\n\n**Sully:** _Art, Animations, Game Design, Sound Design_ \\[[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModSully)]\n\n**Uraneptus:**¬†_Code, Additional Sound Design, Mod Icon/Banner, Documentation_ [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uraneptus2)]\n\n**MiteBeMana:** _Code, Additional Game Design_ [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MiteBeMana)]\n\n**KekeCreations:** Code [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CreationsKeke)]\n\n**A full list of all Contributors can be found here:**¬†[Credits Page](https://github.com/Uraneptus/Sullys-Mod/wiki/Credits)\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## üìãFAQ:\n\n**\"What is planned for the remake?\"**\n- Here is a doc with all of the planned concepts that are done: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0-PYvZDjAtcMZySJMDEGL2xQSIM8Znr9rzibRzqDeA/edit?usp=drivesdk) <br/>\nThere is more to come though!\n\n**\"Why are you remaking the mod?\"**\n- Check this twitter thread out:¬†[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModSully/status/1483351756033732611)\n\n**\"For which minecraft version will the mod be remade?\"**\n- 1.18+.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n¬†","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":661116,"followers":928,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"fbaUxdx3","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:46:18.529195Z","downloads":42280,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1ae3f750a323927508fcf9b6fe43deddefd6ac32687ade5d37283e93e178bdfa3629e719dbdedaf2717f317150f0f47f252ba75ab317663e89964ab7ed3d587","sha1":"f11c4d7010f9572bd2e2ed64c15e544816226e0b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/fbaUxdx3/modelfix-1.14.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14.jar","primary":true,"size":45182,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14.jar"},"mods\\Block+Swap-forge-1.20.1-5.0.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"4227b864ae79eadf2afef5ca79888f135732e85a1feece7022a87d66be23855f184d6018ab69b7b3a7be3847e1da8fd4b6e4954ab853a9bf10e6110e9912c9a4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"f9kXyjJX","slug":"block-swap","project_type":"mod","team":"cx1rDsBY","title":"Block Swap","description":"A simple mod to replace a given block with another.","body":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Block Swap is a simple mod that let's you replace one block with another.

you return to the Title Screen early while your world is still saving in the background!","body":"## FastQuit\n\n### About this mod\n\nThis mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.\n\nDon't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!\n\nThe world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.\nThis is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.\n\nIn its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.\nIf you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.\n\n**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**\n\n### Join the Discord!\n\nIf you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!\n\n### Configure\n\nTo configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.\n\nThere is currently three options to configure:\n\n**Show Toasts**:\n\nDetermines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.\n\n**Background Thread Priority**:\n\nSets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.\nThis is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.\nValue has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.\n\n**Render \"Saving world\" Screen**:\n\nWhen playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.\nBy enabling this setting the \"Saving world\" screen will be rendered.\n\n**Show Saving Time**\n\nDetermines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.\nValue has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

Fight a now much stronger Ender Dragon with multiple phases, increased health, and new attacks. Through other additions like longer lasting dragon breath and elegant particle animations, the Ender Dragon fight is now much more intense and more satisfying to beat.\n\n**Difficulty:** Damage from the True Ending Ender Dragon is scaled by difficulty, so if you're looking for a greater challenge, set your world's game mode to Hard. This also works by making the fight easier with Easy mode.\n\n# Boss Music\n\nTrue Ending adds boss music to the Ender Dragon boss fight! If you're using the datapack version, you'll have to [download the resource pack by clicking here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/true-ending-ender-dragon-music). Mod users won't have to install the resource pack as its already nicely installed along the mod jar file.\n\n# Settings\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure multiple settings in True Ending, like the Ender Dragon's health, through its settings menu by using `/function true_ending:_settings` in chat.\n\n# All Features\n¬†\n<details>\n  <summary>Show All Additions and Changes</summary>\n\n- Ender Dragon Health has increased from 200 HP to 300 HP\n- During the Ender Dragon boss fight, boss music now plays to all players at the center island\n- Ambient particles now surround the arena and players during the Ender Dragon fight\n- Added a dragon dive attack that creates a huge shockwave when the Ender Dragon hits the ground\n - Additionally, a variant where it performs 3 dives (Triple Dive) when perching at 75% health or lower\n- Added a chain fired Dragon Fireball attack\n- Added a huge laser attack\n- Added a final phase where the Ender Dragon hovers above the ground for the player to levitate and deal the last blow mid air.\n- Caged end crystal towers are now broken in a more intuitive way: A phantom guards it and when the phantom is killed, the cage is broken\n- At 10% HP the Ender Dragon will be immune to damage till perched. If not already perched or about to perch, it will forcefully perch after 30 seconds\n- Added an End Crystal counter when an End Crystal is broken displaying how many are left to break\n- Everyone within 128 blocks of the center end island now receives the \"Free the End\" advancement after defeating the Ender Dragon\n- Ender Dragon respawn animation revamped\n- When the Ender Dragon is respawned, a sound is played globally to all players in the end dimension\n- Added an animation for entering and leaving the end\n- Dragon Breath/Area Effect Clouds from Dragon Fireballs duration increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute\n- Dragon Fireballs now deal damage directly on impact\n- Dropped Ender Pearls break from new Ender Dragon attacks (this is to prevent obtaining massive amounts of Ender Pearls from the Enderman killed during the fight)\n- Ender Dragon knockback resistance has been increased massively to prevent arrows from locking the dragon mid-air before perching\n- End Crystal fire is now soul fire\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n***\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT

So, we are up from 4 to <strong>8 octaves</strong>.

A. Q. ‚ùì</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

There will be a message found within the game if the tags are \"cooked\" and more info similar to the base game can be found within the Log of the Server/Client the mod is running.\n\nThe reason behind this mod is the issue that some mod or data pack may add an invalid entry to let's say \"minecraft:mineable/pickaxe\" leading to all pickaxe mineable blocks being unmineable which breaks the game.\n\n**TLDR:** This mod prevents Mod/Datapack mistakes from breaking entire portions of the game.

Delay between runs is configurable\n\n- Single use Macro: Command will only execute once per key press\n\n- Display only Macro: Chat screen will be opened and command will be typed in without being executed\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyrptonaught/CMDKeybinds/master/image.png\" width=\"1343\" height=\"711\" /></p>\n","published":"2022-12-12T08:19:50.922631Z","updated":"2023-11-11T20:42:40.021778Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":34617,"followers":186,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["K7PcKM4C","y3emEjYR","vtVujAR9","JKjtGbBt","NKaHbI7C","O02b8exL","snLr0hHP","FeUSjUHZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/h3r1moh7/976f4cf592fe67d22358aad9a5b75418fdcfbd01.png"},"version":{"id":"snLr0hHP","project_id":"h3r1moh7","author_id":"dTrHFjYJ","featured":false,"name":"Command Macros 1.6.3-1.20","version_number":"1.6.3-1.20","changelog":"Fix config entries not being type-able","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-19T22:07:19.220529Z","downloads":19679,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"55a13b9310118234b897f9f28d3bb681c09cde25e2d8df7808573df89bcf2365ab76f31d1220701b49acfa2620785be8b69d73cab6e63b52f81deaadae688bdf","sha1":"0cf171a575e571727d775c4ae2d0a185896b57e9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/h3r1moh7/versions/snLr0hHP/cmdkeybind-1.6.3-1.20.jar","filename":"cmdkeybind-1.6.3-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":426985,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"XGkCbZVw","user":{"id":"dTrHFjYJ","username":"kyrptonaught","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3196164?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-11-28T19:46:30.324533Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"cmdkeybind-1.6.3-1.20.jar"},"mods\\footprintparticle-0.5.1-mc1.20.jar":{"sha512":"b3e68d2d000e710ed77a16ed6a648b32adc321dd4d7d0ab4872b96bfeeb2568ea6cede7e1697dc910e268d667771d4cf8e726fa8073ca508a12c6bf965076fea","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"xZQOoOaY","slug":"footprintparticle","project_type":"mod","team":"uIH9SlX8","title":"FootprintParticle","description":"A simple mod that adds footprint particle for mobs.","body":"> _I'm just confused that those particle mods have no footprint feature._\n>\n> _I can't find such one, so I made this one._\n\n# Footprint Particle\n\nA simple mod that adds footprint for mobs (and players).

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How
