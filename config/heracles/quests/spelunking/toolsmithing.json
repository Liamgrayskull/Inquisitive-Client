      "With a simple crafting table, one can craft a hammer (of many types, such as wood, stone, blackstone, iron, obsidian, or even netherite) When the crafting table is clicked with a hammer, it will turn into a Workbench, with which you will be able to use a number of tools (such as hammers, shortblades, and shears of varying quality) to craft and customize your own specialized equipment. It is a complex and fickle trade, yet rewarding."
