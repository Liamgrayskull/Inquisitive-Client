      "When exploring, keep an eye out for certain flowering plants. All crops, from both this mod and vanilla, now spawn in nature as Wild Crops. These wild variants are rather rough, and not very suitable for eating, so you'll only be able to forage one sample or seed out of them. However, this might be more than enough to kickstart a humble farm once you settle down somewhere.",
