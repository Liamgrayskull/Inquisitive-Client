      "By manipulating the power of frequencies, either through sculk's capabilities to transmit vibrations, or amethyst's nigh-magical resonance, these properties can be calibrated into specialized radios, microphones, speakers, or transceivers. These devices are configured with a frequency table, and will connect to any device on the same frequency. These devices even work on physics grids!",
      "> - AM: Longer distance frequencies at a loss of quality.",
      "> - FM: Shorter transmission ranges with a superior audio quality.",
      "> - Transceivers: Not unlike a walkie talkie, though with more durability, transceivers allow the broadcasting of voice across wide distances. ",
      "> - Microphone: A block which detects audio in a ~1.5 block radius and broadcasts it on the configured frequency.",
      "> - Speaker & Radio: Blocks which will recieve and play audio transmitted to their frequency."
