      "Ship helms are your window into the basics of ship contraptions, when placed they will enable you to assemble multiple connected blocks into a ship that behaves on it's own physics grid. These will perform best with the rest of Eureka's blockset, balloons providing lift for example. Each block has it's own weight, experiment with various balancing acts!"
