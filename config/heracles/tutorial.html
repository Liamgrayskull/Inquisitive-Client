<h2>Inquisitive</h2>
<p>Welcome to Inquisitive! This is where all documentation will be sourced, updated with each update of the pack, or server update, to teach you about Inquisitive's realms.</p>
<p>Documentation is split into groups. Most groups are self explanitory, but Lore details server-specific details about the happenings of the world, which will update most frequently. </p>
